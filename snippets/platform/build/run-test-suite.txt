h2. Running the test suite

After ensuring PostgreSQL is running under the current user (see instructions above), run the test suite with:

<pre>
script/test
</pre>

If you see something like @'ERROR: could not access file ".../xapian_pg/oxp": Permission denied'@ then you are not running postgres as the same user as the test process.
