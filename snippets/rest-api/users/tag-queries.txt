Tag queries are included in the parameters of the request, and can include multiple tags. For each tag you want to query on, the name of the paramter should be the name of the tag, prefixed by @tag:@. The value of the parameter should be the value of the tag for the users you care about. For instance, a username query could look like: @tag:username=abc123@. The @username@ tag is special, and is used for uniquely identifying users throughout the system.
