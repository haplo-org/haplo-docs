title: Global observation
--

The _Global Observer_ is an integration method that allows an external system to be sent all the data in the Haplo application as a series of messages as data changes, using a generic integration [node:dev/message-queue:message queue].

To use the global observer, install the @haplo_integration_global_observation@ plugin.


h2. Message queue

Messages are sent in the @global@ queue. To find the queue API URLs and create an API key, use the administration interface:

CLICK_PATH Tools > Integrations > Integration message queues > Global observation

If any errors are encountered, these can be viewed in the generic integrations error list:

CLICK_PATH Tools > Integrations > Errors from integrations


h2. Messages

There are various [node:dev/global-observation/message:messages] that are sent by the observer. Other plugins may add additional messages to the queue, so a message queue consumer must filter out any types of messages that it does not understand.

The majority of messages will include an Haplo object in the standard [node:dev/serialisation:JSON serialisation format], and include all message sources available to the application. This will include information on workflows and forms.
