The standard Reporting plugin provides a REST style API for access to information stored in reporting collections.

To get a list of [node:dev/standard-plugin/reporting/collections] in an application, use [node:dev/standard-plugin/reporting/rest-api/collections]. Then, to get information on the facts available, use [node:dev/standard-plugin/reporting/rest-api/collection]. Finally, use [node:dev/standard-plugin/reporting/rest-api/collection-data] to retrieve facts.

All APIs take an optional @output=pretty@ argument to pretty-print the output JSON.

The service user accessing this API must be a member of the @Reporting API@ group (code @std:group:reporting-api@).
