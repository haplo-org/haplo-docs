When a user exports data from a dashboard, a @"std_reporting:export"@ audit event is written to the audit trail.

The data for the entry has keys:

|@collection@|Name of the Collection|
|@dashboard@|Name of the Dashboard|
|@at@|Date and time, as string, of the point in time for which the data was requested|
