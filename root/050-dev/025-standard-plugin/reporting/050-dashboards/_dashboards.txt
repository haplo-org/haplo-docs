title: Dashboards
--

Dashboards are web pages that display a subset of facts from a collection.

h2. Usage

A Dashboard object can be instantiated using @P.reporting.dashboard(E, specification)@

This should be called in a [node:dev/plugin/request-handling:request handler].

The specification has the following properties:

|*Property*|*Description*|
|name|A string naming the dashboard|
|kind|The type of dashboard to be rendered, eg: @"list"@|
|collection|The name of the collection to be used|
|filter|The filter to be applied to the collection|
|title|The human readable title/description of the dashboard for displaying in the UI|

h2. Interface

Functions called on the dashboard object return themselves, and so can be chained.

h3(function). use(featureName, argument, argument2, ...)

Use a defined dashboard feature by name @featureName@.

h3(function). summaryStatistic(priority, statistic)

Displays a summary statistic on the Dashboard.

@priority@ is a number used for sorting the statistics. @statistic@ is a string which is the name of defined name of the statistic.

h3(function). filter(select)

Apply a dashboard specific filter using the [node:dev/plugin/interface/database-query:DatabaseQuery] interface.

h3(function). order(orderBy)

Specify how to order the dashboard on first render, orderBy should either be a fact name, or an array where the first item is the fact name, and the second item specifies the order. 

Multiple orders can be specified, and subsequent orders are used when rows have the same value for the fact specified by the order one up in the hierarchy. See [node:dev/plugin/interface/database-query#order:order].

h3(function). setTime(date)

Specify a date/time for viewing historical data of facts. @date@ must be a JavaScript Date object.

h3(function). display(where, deferred)

Display custom HTML on the dashboard. @where@ specifies where it should be placed, and @deferred@ is the result of [node:dev/plugin/interface/template#deferredRender] on a @Template@.

Different dashboards support different locations, which may include:

|@"above"@|A good place above the main dashboard display|
|@"below"@|Below the main dashboard display|
|@"above-summary"@|Above any summary information|
|@"above-export"@|Above an export button|
|@"above-navigation"@|Above navigation user interface|
|@"above-table"@|Above the main data table|

h3(function). respond()

Generate the Dashboard and serve/render it to the user.

h3(function). deferredRender()

Provides a [node:dev/plugin/interface/template#deferredRender] object for the dashboard. Allows inclusion of dashboards into other templates.

Note that dashboard exports are not possible when deferred rendering, and the Export button will not be displayed.

h2. Services

Dashboards can be modified/setup/added to from outside of the Dashboard specification/dashboard object using services. This allows other plugins to do things like adding columns and statistics to already existing dashboards without modifying the original plugin.

The dashboard will first call the @std:reporting:collection_dashboard:[collection]:setup@ service where @[collection]@ is the name of the collection defined in the dashboard spec. This adds columns to all dashboards using this collection.

Next it will call the @std:reporting:dashboard:[dashboard]:setup@ service where @[dashboard]@ is the name of the dashboard defined in the dashboard spec.

It will then call the @std:reporting:collection_category_dashboard:[collection-category]:setup@ service. This service adds columns to all of the dashboards in the @[collection-category]@ (defined in the collection spec). For example, a plugin could add financial columns to all dashboards in the @example:financial-info@ collection category.

A fourth service will be called *only if the dashboard is exporting*, eg, when generating an excel spreadsheet for download. This service follows the format @std:reporting:dashboard:[dashboard]:setup_export@

All four services are called with one argument, the @dashboard@ object, for example:

<pre>language=javascript
P.implementService("std:reporting:dashboard:example_dashboard:setup",
    function(dashboard) {
        // do things on the dashboard object, add columns etc, eg:
        dashboard.columns(200, [...]);
    }
);
</pre>

h2. Example

An example of how a handler implementing a List Dashboard to display information about a collection of books may look:

<pre>language=javascript
P.respond("GET,POST", "/do/example-plugin/books", [
], function(E, year) {
    var dashboard = P.reporting.dashboard(E, {
        name: "books_dashboard",
        kind: "list",
        collection: "books",
        title: "Books"
    }).
        use("std:row_text_filter", {facts:["title","author"], placeholder:"Search"}).
        use("std:row_object_filter", {fact:"genre", objects:T.Genre}).
        summaryStatistic(0, "count").
        order(["publishedDate", "descending"]).
        columns(10, [
            {type:"linked", style:"wide", column:{fact:"title"}}
        ]).
        columns(100, [
            {fact:"author", link:true, style:"medium"},
            {fact:"genre", style:"medium"},
            {fact:"publishedDate", style:"medium"}
        ]).
        respond();
});
</pre>
