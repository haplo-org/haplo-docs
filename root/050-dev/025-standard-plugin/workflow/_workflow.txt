Plugin name: @std_workflow@

The standard Workflow plugin implements a comprehensive workflow system based on "Finite state machines":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine.

While the theory may sound a little complex, it's actually really simple, and is just a way of turning a flowchart into code. A workflow process can be in one of several defined states, and can transition to a defined set of other states from each of those states.
