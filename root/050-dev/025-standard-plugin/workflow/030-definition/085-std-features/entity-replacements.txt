title: Entity replacements
--

This feature builds on top of the [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/std-features/entities] system to allow you to specify alternatives to those entities. This provides per-instance customisation for workflows, giving some extra flexibility where required.

Usually this functionality will not be required, as the @Entities@ system will be sufficient. It's worth avoiding the extra layer of abstraction if possible.


h2. Using replacement entities

<pre>language=javascript
myWorkflow.use("std:entities:entity_replacement", {
    // replacement entity definitions
    "editorOrNominee": {
        entity: "editor",
        assignableWhen: {flags: ["canAssignReplacements"]},
        replacementTypes: [T.Researcher]
    },
    "adminOrNominee": {
        entity: "admin",
        assignableWhen: {flags: ["canAssignReplacements"]},
        selectableWhen: {flags: ["canAssignReplacements", "adminNotApproved"]}, // optional
        listAll: true,  // optional
        replacementTypes: [T.Staff]
    }
    onFinishPage: function(M) {
        // ... custom logic for smooth integration into the workflow
    }
});
</pre>

In use throughout the consuming workflow plugin, the usage is the same as any non-replaced entity (so from the above definition, using @M.entities.editorOrNominee_ref@ is valid).

Replacements are stored as one-to-one mappings between object [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref:Refs], so replacement is performed by a simple lookup operation.

If no replacement is specified, the original entity is returned.


h2. Configuring entity replacements

@use()@ the @std:entities:entity_replacement@ feature, passing in the specification object, which has keys:


h3(key). replacements

This is an object, specifying a mapping from new entity name to an object specifying which entity to replace, when the replacement can be specified, and what type of object can be used as a replacement.

The @entity@ string must be an entity that is already defined for the workflow.

@assignableWhen@ is a [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/selector:Selector] specifiying when the nominees for that role can be changed.

@selectableWhen@ is an optional [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/selector:Selector] which allows the user to choose whether that entity is selected for this workflow. This sets a flag on the workflow instance object @M@, which follows the naming pattern @entity-selected_ENTITYNAME_ORIGINALREF@. The ref used is that of the original entity, not the replacement, for uniqueness.

These flags can then be used for any custom logic the consuming workflow requires. If @selectableWhen@ is not used then the entity is always selected.

@listAll@ is an optional boolean. When @true@ the underlying entity @_list@ is used, allowing a replacement to be chosen for each of those entities, if required.

@replacementTypes@ is an array of schema types. The replacement [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object:StoreObject] must have one of these types.


h3(function). onFinishPage

Optional. Returns a url to direct the user towards after any entity replacements have been chosen.


h2. User interface

The feature supplies a full functional user interface for viewing and selecting the replacement entities for a workflow. A link is added to the workflow obect's [node:dev/standard-plugin/action-panel], linking to the Overview page.

An @entityReplacementUserInterfaceURL()@ method (taking no arguments) is added to the @M@ workflow object if the ui is needed to be accessed from elsewhere.

h4. Overview

This gives a table of the entities that have been changed, their original value, and the replacement. If the @assignableWhen@ selector is @true@, then a @set@ or @change@ link will be displayed to the user.

h4. Form

A very simple form page, displaying the original entity and a lookup field for replacing it. The lookup is restricted to suggesting objects of the replacement's @replacementTypes@.


h2. Text

The text for use in the ui should be added to the workflow  [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/text] interface.

The following names are searched:

h4. Displayable entity names

* entity-replacement:display-name:editorOrNominee
* entity-replacement:display-name

Either a generic displayable value can be given, or a user-readable name supplied for each of your replacement entitites

h4. Page titles

* entity-replacement:page-title:overview
* entity-replacement:page-title:form
* entity-replacement:page-title

These are optional, with sensible defaults used if left undefined
