title: States dashboard
--

The @std:dashboard:states@ feature implements a dashboard which displays counts of processes at each state.

It can be filtered and additional UI added.

<pre>language=javascript
EgWorkflow.use("std:dashboard:states", {
    title: "Example task progress",
    path: "/do/example/progress-dashboard",
    columnTag: "department",
    canViewDashboard: function(dashboard, user) {
        return user.isMemberOf(Group.ViewDashboard);
    },
    states: [
        "review_project",
        "wait_reviewer",
        "check_rejection",
        "approved",
        "rejected"
    ]
});
</pre>

Your plugin is responsible for providing some UI to link to the dashboard at @/do/example/progress-dashboard@.


h2. Usage

The second argument to @use()@ is the configuration, which has properties:

h3(key). title

The name of the dashboard, displayed as the page title.


h3(key). layout

The layout for the page. Consider setting to @"std:wide"@ if there are lots of columns.


h3(key). path

The path for the generated [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/request-handling#respond] call on your plugin. The path must be within your plugin's namespace.


h3(key). configurationService

If present, the named service will be called with a copy of the specification to apply common configuration to state dashboards.


h3(key). canViewDashboard

@function(dashboard, user)@

A function which returns @true@ when a user is permitted to view the dashboard. The function takes two arguments, the @dashboard@ object and the @user@.


h3(key). states

An array containing the states which should be displayed on the dashboard, in order.


h3(key). mergeStates

Optional. A dictionary of state name to an array of other state names. The other states are considered the same when counting and listing workflow instances.

For example, to report @"returned"@, @"returned2"@ and @"returned3"@ as a single line in the dashboard, use something like:

<pre>language=javascript
  states: [
    "submitted", "returned", "rejected", "approved"
  ],
  mergeStates: {
    "returned": ["returned2", "returned3"]
  }
</pre>

When merging states, choose one to act as the state in the list of states for the dashboard, @"returned"@ in this case, and include it in the right place in the @states@ array. Then use @mergeStates@ to list the states which should be merged into that state.


h3(key). columnTag

The name of the tag to use to split the instances into columns.


h3(key). columnTagToName

@function(value)@

Returns a user visible heading for the column, given the tag value.


h3(key). setup

@function(dashboard, E)@

A function called to set up the dashboard object for the given [node:dev/plugin/interface/exchange].



h2. Dashboard interface

The feature configuration calls functions with a @Dashboard@ object to allow you to configure it and add extra UI.


h3(function). addLinkParameter(key, value)

If you're providing extra UI, for example, year navigation, you can use this to add parameters to the URL. These will be available within @E.parameters@ in your @setup()@ function.


h3(function). addHeaderDeferred(deferred)

Add additional UI in the header, as a deferred render created by [node:dev/plugin/interface/template#deferredRender].


h3(function). addQueryFilter(fn)

Add a filter function which will be called to filter the dashboard using the [node:dev/plugin/interface/work-unit-query] functions to refine the query.

For example:

<pre>language=javascript
  setup: function(dashboard, E) {
      var year = O.ref(E.request.parameters.year);
      if(year) {
          dashboard.addQueryFilter(function(query) {
              query.tag("year", year);
          });
      }
  }
</pre>


h3(function). setTitle(title)

Override the default page title, for example, by adding the year.



h2. Text

The dashboard system uses the text system, but interpolation is *not* used as there is no active instance.

h4. Transition name on dashboard

 * dashboard-status:STATE
 * status:STATE
