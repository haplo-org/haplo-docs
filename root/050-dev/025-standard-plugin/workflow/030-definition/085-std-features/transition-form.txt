title: Transition form
--

This feature adds a form at the top of the standard [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/text/transition-ui] which must be completed by the actionable user before the pending transition can take place. The document from the form is then saved in the timeline entry upon transitioning.

This provides an alternative place to place forms that do not necessarily require an entire [node:dev/standard-plugin/document-store/definition:Document store definition] but that may still be essential to certain parts of a workflow.

h2. Using transition forms

<pre>language=javascript
EgWorkflow.use("std:transition_form", {
    
    selector: { state: "wait_supervisor" },
    
    transitions: ["progress"],
    
    form: P.form({
        specificationVersion: 0,
        formId: "exampleForm",
        formTitle: "Example form",
        elements: [
            // ...
        ]
    }),
    
    onTransition: function(M, document) {
        // called just before transition
    }
});
</pre>

h2. Usage

@use()@ the @std:transition_form@ feature, passing in the specification object, which has keys:

h3(key). selector

A [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/selector:selector] for the transition form.

h3(key). transitions

The list of transitions for which the form is required.

h3(key). form

The [node:/dev/plugin/interface/form-description] to display on transition UI.

h3(key). prepareFormInstance

@function(key, instance)@

Allows preparation of the form instance, such as setting up [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-instance#choices:dynamic form choices]. See [node:dev/standard-plugin/document-store/definition#prepareFormInstance] for usage examples.

h3(key). onTransition

@function(key, document)@

If this function is specified, it will be called just before the transition is committed.

h2. Errors

Error messages are rendered at the top of the form if the form is left incomplete. The text for these can be easily customised using [node:/dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/text/transition-form:the Workflow text system].
