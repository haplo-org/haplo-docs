The workflow text system allows you to configure the text which appears in the user interface.

You add text to the system with the @text()@ function on the Workflow object, which takes a dictionary of text names to strings, for example

<pre>language=javascript
EgWorkflow.text({
    "status:approved": "Approved",
    "status:rejected": "Rejected",
    "status:wait_head": "Waiting for NAME(Head of Department)"
});
</pre>

You can call @text()@ as many times as you need.

All text strings are subject to interpolation by [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/function-lists#textInterpolate] functions.

By default, the @NAME(name)@ interpolation calls the [node:plugin/misc/name] function to translate names of things. Note there are no quotes within the brackets, as in the example above. See [node:plugin/misc/name#String_interpolation] for details.

You can retrieve the text string from the name by calling [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/interfaces/instance:getTextMaybe()] on an instance of that workflow.

h2. Searching for strings

To avoid having to set lots of strings for every possible case, the text system has a list of string it'll search. The most specific string will be used.

In the documented search paths, placeholders will be used:

 * STATE - name of a state
 * TRANSITION - name of a transition
