The workflow text system allows you to configure the text which appears in the user interface.

You add text to the system with the @text()@ function on the Workflow object, which takes a dictionary of text names to strings, for example

<pre>language=javascript
EgWorkflow.text({
    "status:approved": "Approved",
    "status:rejected": "Rejected"
});
</pre>

You can call @text()@ as many times as you need.

All text strings are subject to interpolation by [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/function-lists#textInterpolate] functions.


h2. Searching for strings

To avoid having to set lots of strings for every possible case, the text system has a list of string it'll search. The most specific string will be used.

In the documentated search paths, placeholders will be used:

 * STATE - name of a state
 * TRANSITION - name of a transition
