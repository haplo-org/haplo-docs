Workflows are implemented in their own plugin, using the framework in the standard Workflow plugin.


h2. 1) Install Workflow plugin

Ensure that the @std_workflow@ plugin is installed.


h2. 2) Create a new plugin

It's best if workflows, and any directly associated UI, are implemented in their own plugin.

First, you must [node:dev/plugin/plugin-json#use:use] the @std:workflow@ [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/platform-interface#provideFeature:feature] in your @plugin.json@ file:

<pre>language=json
{
  "pluginName": "example_workflow",
  // ... rest of plugin.json
  "use": ["std:workflow"]
}
</pre>



h2. 3) Implement Definition object

Your plugin then creates a new workflow definition and repeatedly calls functions on it to build the workflow.

<pre>language=javascript
var EgWorkflow = P.workflow.implement("eg", "Example workflow");
</pre>

By convention, use a name which describes your workflow, with the suffix @Workflow@, for example, @ProjectApprovalWorkflow@.

In this documentation, we'll use @EgWorkflow@ to represent the definition object.


h3(function). P.workflow.implement(name, readableName)

This function returns a new Workflow Definition object, which implements the API described in [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition:this section].

@name@ is the name of the workflow, which will be prefixed by your plugin name. It's passed to [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/platform-interface#workUnit] when the underlying @WorkUnit@ object is defined.

@readableName@ is the human readable name of the process, used in the UI.


h2. 4) Configure Definition object

To build up the workflow,

 * Define [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/states:states]

 * Set up [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/handlers:handlers] and [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/function-lists:functions]

 * Include the [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/std-features:standard features] useful for your workflow, and any other [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/features:features] from plugins providing workflow components

 * Set the [node:dev/standard-plugin/workflow/definition/text:text] for your user interface
