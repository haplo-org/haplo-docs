title: HSVT templates
--

h3. Text

Text that will appear in the user interface should be included in the HSVT file. For example, the @pageTitle()@ and @backLink()@ functions should be preferred to passing text in to the view from JavsaScript.

Always prepare the text in your templates for [node:plugin/i18n:internationalisation], except if you know it'll never be needed because it's a bespoke feature for a single client.

h3. Whitespace

HSVT ignores whitespace, so use it to increase the clarity of your HTML structure. In particular, an angle bracket should always have whitespace around it.

<pre>language=hsvt
<div>
  if(canEdit) {
    <p>
      <a href="..."> i("Edit") </a>
    </p>
  }
</pre>

h3. Layout

HSVT files should be indented 2 spaces and follow the same conventions as JavaScript for control flow.
