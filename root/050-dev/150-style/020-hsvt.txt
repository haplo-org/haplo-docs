h3. Text

Text that will appear in HTML should be included in the HSVT file preferentially. For example, the @pageTitle()@ and @backLink()@ functions should be preferred to passing text in to the view from JavsaScript.

Always prepare the text in your templates for [node:plugin/i18n:internationalisation].

h3. Layout

HSVT files should be indented 2 spaces.
