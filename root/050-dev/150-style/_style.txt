title: Style guide

The aim of this style guide is to provide a reference for the usual conventions followed through Haplo plugin code, resulting in a consistent look and feel for plugins built for the Haplo platform.

These are not enforced by a linter or the plugin tool, and can be ignored if there is a good reason to do so. A plugin that is literate and consistent is more important than sticking rigidly to the recommended style.
