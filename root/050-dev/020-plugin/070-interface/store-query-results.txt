A JavaScript object implementing the @StoreQuery@ interface represents the result of a query of objects within the object store.


h2. Construction

Call [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-query#execute] on a [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-query] object.


h2. Interface

h3(acts_as). Array

The query results behave as a read-only JavaScript @Array@, using the @[]@ operator to retrieve an object.


h3(property). length

Number of results.


h3(function). each(iterator)

Calls @iterator@, once for each object. Arguments are @(object, index)@, where @index@ is the index of the object in this 'array'.

Return @true@ from the @iterator@ function to stop the iteration immediately.


h3(function). ensureRangeLoaded(startIndex, endIndex)

If this is a sparse result set, requested by calling @setSparseResults(true)@ on the query object, use this function to load a range of objects.

This is more efficient than just loading each object individually by accessing the array.
