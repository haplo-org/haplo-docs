A JavaScript object implementing the @FileIdentifier@ interface is a reference to a [node:dev/plugin/interface/file] used as a value within a [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object]. It includes extra information to implement the user interface for 'file version tracks' provided by the Platform.

The digest and fileSize are used to unambiguously identify the @File@ to which it refers.


h2. Construction

Use [node:dev/plugin/interface/file#identifier] on a @File@ object, or @mutableCopy()@ on a @FileIdentifier@ object(),


h2. Interface

h3(function). mutableCopy()

Returns a mutable copy of this @FileIdentifier@.


h2. Interface (read only properties)

h3(property). digest

The digest of the file, as a hex encoded @String@.


h3(property). fileSize

The size of the file, in bytes, as a number.


h2. Interface (mutable properties)

If a @FileIdentifier@ is created using the [node:dev/plugin/interface/file#identifier] function of a @File@ object, or a mutable copy made with @mutableCopy()@, the following properties are read/write.


h3(property). mimeType

The MIME type of the file. This does not have to match the @mimeType@ property of the underlying @File@.


h3(property). filename

The filename of the file. This does not have to match the @filename@ property of the underlying @File@.


h3(property). trackingId

A randomly generated @String@ for tracking versions within a 'file version track'. Used for generating the version listings in the web user interface.


h3(property). version

The version of this version within a 'file version track', as a @String@.


h3(property). logMessage

A @String@ containing the user's description of the changes made in this version within a 'file version track'.
