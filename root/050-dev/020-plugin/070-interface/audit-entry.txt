A JavaScript object implementing the @AuditEntry@ interface represents an audit trail entry.


h2. Construction

Use @O.audit.write()@ to write to the [node:dev/plugin/o/audit-trail:audit trail].

Passed to the [node:dev/plugin/hook/audit-entry-optional-write] hook.


h2. Interface

h3(property). auditEntryType

A @String@ representing the type of audit entry.


h3(property). ref

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] of the store object this audit entries is about, or @null@ if it is not about an object.


h3(property). data

A JSON compatible data structure giving additional details about the entry.


h3(property). creationDate

The @Date@ when the entry was written.


h3(property). remoteAddress

A @String@ representing the remote address of the request, or @null@ if the entry was not written in response to a request.


h3(property). userId

The user ID of the user who made the request which prompted this entry.

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/lookup/user] to retrieve user information.
