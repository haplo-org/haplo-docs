Represents a read-only list of labels applied to an object.


h2. Construction

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/label-list].


h2. Interface

h3(property). length

The number of labels in the list.


h3(function). includes(ref)

@true@ if the list includes the label, otherwise @false@.


h3(function). filterToLabelsOfType(types)

Returns a new @LabelList@ which contains all the labels from this list which are of one of the types specified by @types@, an array of one or more @Ref@ objects.

The types specified are matched *exactly*, ignoring the hierarchy of sub-types. If you need to filter including sub-types, you will have to pass all the sub-types in yourself.

For example, to filter a list so it only contains labels configured in system management, use:

<pre>language=javascript
    var filtered = labels.filterToLabelsOfType([TYPE["std:type:label"]]);
</pre>
