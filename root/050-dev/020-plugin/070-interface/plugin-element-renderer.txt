A JavaScript object implementing the @PluginElementRenderer@ interface provides information about the context in which an Element is being rendered, and functions to generate the Element HTML using templates.


h2. Construction

Automatically created by the built in Element rendering API, and passed to renderer functions. See [node:dev/plugin/elements].


h2. Interface

h3(property). name

The name of the Element being rendered.


h3(property). path

The path of the page requested by the user.


h3(property). object

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object] this Element is being displayed next to, if the Element is being rendered on an object page.

Otherwise, this property is @null@.


h3(property). style

A hint about how the Element should be rendered. Values can be @"narrow"@ or @"wide"@, depending on where on the page the Element will be displayed.


h3(property). options

Any options specified by the system administrator when declaring the Element to be displayed in a context. The options are decoded from JSON.

If no options are specified, or there is an error decoding them, this property is @{}@.


h3(function). render(view, templateName)

This function generates the Element HTML by rendering a [node:dev/plugin/interface/template].

The @templateName@ argument is optional. If it's not specified or is @null@, then an implied name will be used. This is the name of the Element, without the plugin name prefix. For example, the @example_plugin:test@ Element would use the @test@ template unless another template was specified.

As well as the values required by the template, the @view@ should contain the @title@ key. This specifies the title of the Element. Use @""@ if you don't want a title to be displayed above the Element.


h3(function). renderLinks(links, title)

This is a shortcut to implementing the common case of displaying links to plugin functionality on the application home page.

@links@ is an array of two element arrays, containing the path and text for the link. For example,

<pre>language=javascript
    [
        ['/do/example/action_one', 'Action One'],
        ['/do/example/action_two', 'Action Two']
    ]
</pre>

@title@ is the title of the Element.
