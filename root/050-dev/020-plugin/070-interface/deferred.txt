A JavaScript object implementing a deferred rendering of a [node:dev/plugin/interface/template].

See [node:dev/plugin/templates] for how to use @Template@ objects and [node:dev/plugin/templates/including-templates#Deferred_rendering] for how to use deferred renders.

Generally you will not call methods on these objects, as they're used within views for other templates.


h2. Construction

Obtain a @Deferred@ object using the [node:dev/plugin/interface/template#deferredRender] function on a @Template@.


h2. Interface

h3(function). immediate()

Render the deferred rendering immediately, returning another @Deferred@ object.
