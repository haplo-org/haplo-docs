Collects a list of rules for generating [node:dev/plugin/interface/label-statements]. Also used for collecting dynamically generated permission rules for a User.


h2. Construction

Created by the Platform and passed to the [node:dev/plugin/hook/user-permission-rules] hook.

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/label-statements-builder] to create your own when you need to create a [node:dev/plugin/interface/label-statements] object.


h2. Interface

h3(function). rule(label, statement, permissions)

Add a rule.

@label@ is the [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] of any store object.

@statement@ is a @O.STATEMENT_*@ constant.

@permissions@ is one or more @O.PERM_*@ constants ORed together.


h3(function). add(label, statement, permissions)

Alias for @rule()@ so the code in [node:dev/plugin/hook/user-permission-rules] hooks reads a bit more nicely.


h3(function). toLabelStatements()

Creates a [node:dev/plugin/interface/label-statements] object by applying the rules specified by the calls to @rule()@.
