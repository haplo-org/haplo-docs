A JavaScript object implementing the @File@ interface represents a file stored and managed by the platform's file store.

h2. Construction

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/file].


h2. Interface

h3(property). digest

The digest of the file, as a hex encoded @String@.


h3(property). fileSize

The size of the file, in bytes, as a number.


h3(property). mimeType

The MIME type of the file, as set by the browser when the file was originally uploaded. Note that some MIME types are standardised as browsers tend to be a bit inconsistent.


h3(property). filename

The filename of the file, as set by the browser when the file was originally uploaded.

Note that if a file is uploaded again, it's still only stored once, and the original filename isn't changed. Users can use a different filename by using a [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-identifier].


h3(property). basename

The filename of the file, without the file extension.


h3(property). createdAt

The @Date@ when the file was originally uploaded for the first time.


h3(function). identifier()

Create a new [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-identifier] which refers to this file, with a random @trackingId@.


h3(function). secret

The file's secret, as a @String@. You must *always* check the secret with the @checkSecret()@ function.


h3(function). checkSecret(secret)

Compare the given secret with the file's secret using a timing-attack resistant comparison algorithm. If the secret does not match, an exception is thrown.


h3(property). properties

A JavaScript @Object@, as a dictionary, containing additional properties of the file. These may not be available either because the file has not been processed yet, processing encountered an error, or the properties are not applicable to that file type.

@numberOfPages@: Number of pages in the file.

@dimensions@: Physical dimensions of the document represented by the file, with keys @width@, @height@ and @units@.

@thumbnail@: The size of the thumbnail, if available, with keys @width@, @height@ and @mimeType@.


h3(function). url(options)

Return a URL which can be used to download this file. See below for the optional @options@ argument.


h3(function). toHTML(options)

Return some HTML which can be included in a web page. See below for the optional @options@ argument.


h2. Options

|_Property_|_Description_|_Default_|
|@transform@|Transform to be applied to the file|@null@|
|@asFullURL@|Whether to include the hostname in the URL|@false@|
|@authenticationSignature@|Sign the URL to bypass the usual file download authentication. Note that this signature is only valid for the current user session.|@false@|
|@linkToDownload@|When generating HTML, include a link to download the file.|@false@|
|@forceDownload@|Set the Content-Disposition to attachment to force the browser to download the file, rather than displaying it.|@false@|
