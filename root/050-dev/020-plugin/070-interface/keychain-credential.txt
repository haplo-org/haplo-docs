A JavaScript object implementing the @KeychainCredential@ interface represents an entry in the application's [node:dev/plugin/o/keychain]. These store account information and secrets such as passwords, used to configure the platform and plugins.

The @"pKeychainRead"@ privilege is required to use the keychain.


h2. Construction

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/keychain#O_keychain_credential_id] to load a credential by ID or name.

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/keychain#O_keychain_query] to discover what credentials are available in the keychain.

The ID of this credential.


h3(property). name

The name of this credential.

The overall kind of credential, for example, @"Generic"@ or @"HTTP"@.


h3(property). instanceKind

The specific kind of credential which specifies the kind of credential (eg @"Basic"@ for HTTP), or system to which it connects (eg @"LDAP"@ for authentication services).


h3(property). account

A JavaScript object with properties specifying the account details, for example, a username.

The property names are the names specified in the System Management user interface.


h3(property). secret

A JavaScript object with properties specifying the secrets necessary to authenticate, for example, a password.
