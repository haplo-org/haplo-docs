A JavaScript object implementing the @PluginWorkUnitRenderer@ interface provides information about the context in which a WorkUnit is being rendered, and functions to generate the WorkUnit HTML using templates.

Your plugin doesn't have to call the @render()@ function when it's asked to render a work unit, and if it doesn't, nothing will be displayed. This can be useful to omit irrelevant work units from the object page. However, plugins should *always* render work units on the Tasks list so the count matches the number of tasks displayed. Use the @context@ property to tell the difference.


h2. Construction

Automatically created by the built in WorkUnit rendering API, and passed to renderer functions. See [node:dev/plugin/work-flow].


h2. Interface

h3(property). workUnit

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/work-unit] object being rendered.


h3(property). context

The context within which the work unit is being rendered.

|*Value*|*Location of display*|
|@"object"@|The object page.|
|@"list"@|The Tasks listing.|

If @context@ has any other value, use the same rendering as you would for @"list"@.


h3(function). render(view, template)

This function generates the work unit HTML by rendering a template.

The @template@ argument is optional, and can either be a [node:dev/plugin/interface/template] object, or the name of a template as a @String@.

If it's not specified or is @null@, then an implied template will be used. This is the name of the work type, without the plugin name prefix. For example, the @example_plugin:action@ work type would use the @action@ template unless another template was specified.


h2. Extra information in the view

As well as the values required by the template, the @view@ may contain:


h3(key). fullInfo

The link to the user interface for this work unit, for example, @"/do/example/action/1234"@. The link will be displayed to the right of the work unit.

It is the plugin's responsibility to perform any HTML escaping required on this link, as it will be output in the HTML exactly as given.

If this property is not specified, no link will be displayed.


h3(key). fullInfoText

By default, the @fullInfo@ link uses the text "Full info...". Set this property to override the default.
