A JavaScript object implementing the @UploadedFile@ interface represents a file which has just been uploaded in an HTTP request. Unless it is stored, using [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/file], it will be deleted at the end of the request.


h2. Construction

Declare an @as:"file"@ argument on a [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/request-handling:request handler].


h2. Interface

h3(property). digest

The digest of the file, as a hex encoded @String@.


h3(property). fileSize

The size of the file, in bytes, as a number.


h3(property). mimeType

The MIME type of the file. Note that some MIME types are standardised as browsers tend to be a bit inconsistent.


h3(property). filename

The filename of the file, as set by the browser.


h3(function). readAsString(charsetName)

Return the contents of the binary data, interpreted as a string in the given character set, eg @"UTF-8"@.

Use this function with care, checking the @fileSize@ property before calling it, as it is very easy to accidently run out of memory.
