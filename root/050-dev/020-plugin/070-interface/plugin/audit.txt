Plugins can write their own audit trail entries, and control which optional events are audited. See [node:dev/plugin/o/audit-trail] and the [node:dev/plugin/hook/audit-entry-optional-write] hook.


h2. Interface

h3(function). declareAuditEntryOptionalWritePolicy(policy)

If you implement the [node:dev/plugin/hook/audit-entry-optional-write] hook, you should call this function to declare the policy you are implementing. It will be shown on the audit configuration page in System Management.

The policy can be a @String@, or a @function@. If the latter, the function will be called every time the policy is displayed, with @this@ set to your @Plugin@ object.

<pre>language=javascript
P.declareAuditEntryOptionalWritePolicy(
    "Auditing policy description."
);
</pre>
