These APIs allow your plugin to integrated with the file store.

h3(function). fileTransformPipelineCallback(name, callbacks)

Call this function to register @callbacks@ to handle completion of [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-pipeline:file transform pipelines] with the given @name@.

@name@ should include the plugin name to avoid clashes.

@callbacks@ contains one or both of @success@ and @error@ functions, which are called with a [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-result] object as their single argument.

For example,

<pre>language=javascript
P.fileTransformPipelineCallback("example_plugin:example", {
    success: function(result) {
        // Do something when the pipeline completes successfully.
    },
    error: function(result) {
        // Do something to recover from the error.
    }
});
</pre>

If you do not need to store the result of the pipeline in the file store, it may be easier to just use the [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-pipeline#Interface_download_of_results:functions for generating URLs and views] instead.
