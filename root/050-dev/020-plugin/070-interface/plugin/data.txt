Your plugin object provides data storage facilities to store arbitrary data outside the main object store. The @data@ property allows for a small amount of JSON-compatible data to be stored, and the @db@ property provides a full relational database.



h2. Interface

h3(property). db

The plugin's database object, implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/database] interface. Only valid if [node:dev/plugin/plugin-json] defines @useDatabase@ as @true@.

See [node:dev/plugin/database] for how to use the plugin's database.


h3(property). data

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/data-store] object for this plugin. Plugins can use this to store small amounts of arbitrary data.

Note there are restrictions and limitations on the data which can be stored. See the [node:dev/plugin/interface/data-store] documentation for details.
