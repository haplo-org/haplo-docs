long_title: Plugin bundled files
--

Files bundled in the plugin's @[node:dev/plugin/directory-structure#file]@ directory are intended for storing small resources.

It's recommended you use bundled files for storing form specifications, which are lazily loaded when you use the plugin's @[node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/form:form()]@ method.

h2. Interface

h3(function). loadFile(pathname)

Load a file from the plugin's [node:dev/plugin/directory-structure#file] directory, returning a [node:dev/plugin/interface/binary-data] object.


h3(function). hasFile(pathname)

Returns @true@ if the plugin has a file with the given @pathname@.


h2. Example

To lazily load a lookup table from the @file/lookup/departments.json@, use code like:

<pre>language=javascript
var departmentsLookupCached;
var getDepartmentsLookup() {
    if(!departmentsLookupCached) {
        departmentsLookupCached =
          P.loadFile("lookup/departments.json").readAsJSON();
    }
    return departmentsLookupCached;
}
</pre>
