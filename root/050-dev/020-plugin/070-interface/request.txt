A JavaScript object implementing the @Request@ interface represents an HTTP request.


h2. Construction

Constructed by the Platform when a plugin handles a request, available through the @request@ property of the [node:dev/plugin/interface/exchange] object.


h2. Interface

h3(property). method

HTTP method. @"GET"@ or @"POST"@.


h3(property). path

The requested URL path.

For example, @"/do/example/object"@.


h3(property). extraPathElements

An array of path elements below the root URL of the handler.

For example, @["123y7","view"]@ for a request of @/do/example/object/123y7/view@.


h3(property). parameters

The parameters from the @GET@ url and the @POST@ body. @POST@ parameters take precedence.

Both the keys and values are @String@ values.

If a key name contains @[]@, it is used to build a nested structure. For example,

<pre>
    id=123&user[name]=John&user[address][city]=London&user[address][postcode]=SE1%201AA
</pre>

would result in the structure

<pre>language=json
{
    id: "123",
    user: {
        name: "John",
        address: {
            city: "London",
            postcode: "SE1 1AA"
        }
    }
}
</pre>


h3(property). headers

The HTTP request headers, as an @Object@ with properties named after the headers, normalised so that each word is capitalised (eg @User-Agent@). The values are arrays containing the header values as strings. These arrays are never empty.

Arrays are used instead of simple strings because HTTP allows for repeated headers.


h3(property). remote

Information about the remote host making the request.

The object has two properties, @protocol@ which is a string value giving the protocol name, for example, @"IPv4"@, and @address@, which is the address of the remote host converted to a string.

If you are using the remote address for access control, make sure you check the protocol as well as the address, and deny access if the protocol isn't one you expect.

For example, within a request handler:

|*Property path*|*Value*|
|@E.request.remote.protocol@|@"IPv4"@|
|@E.request.remote.address@|@"10.1.2.3"@|


h3(property). body

The raw request body, interpreted as a UTF-8 string.
