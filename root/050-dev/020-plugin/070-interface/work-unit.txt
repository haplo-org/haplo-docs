A JavaScript object implementing the @WorkUnit@ interface represents a unit of work within the workflow system.


h2. Construction

Create a new @WorkUnit@ with [node:dev/plugin/o/work-flow/create].

Load an existing @WorkUnit@ given its ID with [node:dev/plugin/o/work-flow/load].

Find existing @WorkUnit@ objects with [node:dev/plugin/o/work-flow/query].

Render a @WorkUnit@ to HTML when requested by the [node:dev/plugin/hook/work-unit-render] hook.


h2. Usage

Set properties, then call @save()@ commit the changes.


h2. Interface

h3(property). id

The numeric @ID@ of this work unit.

Accessing this property on a work unit which has not been saved with @save()@ will throw an exception.


h3(property). workType

The type of work, as a @String@. This should in the form @plugin_name:type@ to avoid clashing with other plugins.


h3(property). ref

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] of a store object to which this @WorkUnit@ refers. This causes the work unit to be displayed on that object's page.


h3(property). closed

Boolean. @true@ if this work unit is closed.


h3(property). createdAt

Date. When this work unit was created.


h3(property). openedAt

Date. When this work unit was opened. May be in the future.


h3(property). deadline

Date. When this work unit must be closed by.


h3(property). closedAt

Date. When this work unit was closed.


h3(property). createdBy

Who created this work unit, read as a [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal].

This property can be set with a numeric ID or a [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal] object.


h3(property). actionableBy

Which user or group can action and close this work unit, read as a [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal].

This property can be set with a numeric ID or a [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal] object. Use the schema [node:dev/plugin/schema/schema-global/group] constants for specifying groups.


h3(property). closedBy

Which user or group can action and closed this work unit, read as a [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal], or @null@ if it's open.

This property can be set with a numeric ID or a [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal] object.


h3(property). tags

An @Object@-like dictionary of short @String@ to @String@ key value pairs. Use for values that you will use in work unit queries and reporting, and the @data@ property for all other information.

@Ref@ objects will be automatically converted to a @String@, but otherwise, an exception will be raised if a non-@String@ object is assigned to a key.

Work unit tags are indexed, and can be efficiently queried with a [node:dev/plugin/interface/work-unit-query] [node:dev/plugin/interface/work-unit-query#tag] function.

Tags can be used for simple reporting, using the [node:dev/plugin/interface/work-unit-query#countByTags] function.


h3(property). data

JavaScript @Object@, which can only contain items which can be serialised to JSON. Use to store arbitrary data about the state of your workflow.

Note this is *not* a @DataStore@ object, and the changes made are only saved when the @save()@ function is called.


h3(function). isActionableBy(user)

Returns @true@ if this work unit is actionable by @user@, either by being directly assigned to the work unit, or through group membership.


h3(function). close(closedBy)

Close the work unit. @closedBy@ is either the ID of the closing user, or a [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal] object.

You must call @save()@ to commit this change.


h3(function). reopen()

Reopen the work unit.

You must call @save()@ to commit this change.


h3(function). save()

Commit the changes to the work unit.


h3(property). isSaved

@true@ if this work unit has been saved with @save()@.


h3(function). deleteObject()

Delete this work unit.

If it's useful to keep the work unit in the system as a record of a past action, consider closing the work unit and saving it instead of deleting it.


h3(property). visible

@true@ if this work unit is visible in listings of work units.


h3(property). autoVisible

@true@ if the platform should apply [node:dev/plugin/work-flow#Visibility:sensible rules] for setting the @visible@ property.
