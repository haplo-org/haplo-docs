A JavaScript object implementing the @FileTransformResult@ interface is passed to the [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/file-store:callback functions] registered to handle completion of [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-pipeline:file transform pipelines].

h2. Construction

@FileTransformResult@ objects are constructed by the platform on completion of file transform pipelines.


h2. Interface

h3(property). data

Arbitrary JSON compatible data, passed to [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/file-transform-pipeline]. Use this to identify why the pipeline was executed in your callbacks.


h3(function). file(name, filename)

Permanently store a pipeline result in the file store, and return a [node:dev/plugin/interface/file] object representing it.

@name@ is the name of the file in the pipeline's file list, usually @"output"@.

@filename@ is the user visible name of the file which will be used by default when downloading the file at a later date. Remember to include an extension.

If the @filename@ has no extension, or the wrong extension, an appropriate file extension will be added.


h3(property). name

Name of the pipeline, as passed to [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/file-transform-pipeline] and registered with the [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/file-store:callback functions].


h3(property). success

Boolean value, indicating successful completion of the pipeline.


h3(property). errorMessage

A human readable string indicating the error, used for debugging. It should not be presented to the user in your UI.
