A JavaScript object implementing the @StoreObjectMutable@ interface is an object in the Object Store which can be modified, then saved back to the store.

@StoreObjectMutable@ objects also implement the [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object] interface.


h2. Construction

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/object] or [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object#mutableCopy] on [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object] objects.



h2. Interface

h3(acts_as). StoreObject

All properties and functions in the [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object] interface are implemented.


h3(function). save(labelChanges)

Creates or updates the object in the store.

@labelChanges@ is optional, and if present, is used to add or remove labels from the defaults, or those specified when calling @O.object()@. If you *only* want to change the labels, use [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object#relabel] instead.


h3(function). append(value, desc, qual)

Append a value to the object, with the specified @desc@ from the schema [node:dev/plugin/schema/schema-global/attr] constants. @qual@ can be omitted, or use @QUAL["std:qualifier:null"]@ to specify no qualifier.

The value can be:

|*Type*|*Notes*|
|[node:dev/plugin/interface/ref]|Link to another object|
|[node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object]|@ref@ property used for linking to the object|
|[node:dev/plugin/interface/text]|Any text object created with [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor/text]|
|@String@|Automatically converted into a [node:/dev/plugin/interface/text]|
|[node:dev/plugin/interface/date-time]|Variable precision date and time|
|@Date@|Automatically converted into a [node:dev/plugin/interface/date-time] with Day precision|

Use @appendWithIntValue()@ if you want to add integers.


h3(function). appendWithIntValue(value, desc, qual)

As @append()@, but with a workaround for JavaScript's unhelpful use of floating point numbers for all numeric values.

@value@ must be a number, and is converted into an integer value before appending to the object.


h3(function). appendType(value, qual)

Shortcut for @append(value, ATTR["dc:attribute:type"], qual)@


h3(function). appendTitle(value, qual)

Shortcut for @append(value, ATTR["dc:attribute:title"], qual)@


h3(function). appendParent(value, qual)

Shortcut for @append(value, ATTR["std:attribute:parent"], qual)@


h3(function). remove(desc, qual, iterator)

Remove zero or more values from the object. @desc@ is required, @qual@ can be omitted to specify any qualifier (If @QUAL["std:qualifier:null"]@ is used for @qual@, it will only remove values without a qualifier).

If an @iterator@ is passed as the last argument, it will be called with @(value, desc, qual)@ arguments. If it returns @true@, the value will be deleted.


h3(function). preallocateRef()

Preallocate the @ref@ for a new object before @save()@ is called.

@preallocateRef()@ will throw an exception if it is called when the @ref@ has already been allocated, either by calling this function or @save()@.

Returns the new @ref@.


h2. Interface (computed attributes)

h3(property). willComputeAttributes

@true@ if the object will [node:dev/plugin/schema/computed-attributes:compute attributes] the next time it is saved or the platform uses attribute values.


h3(function). computeAttributesIfRequired()

If the object has been modified since attributes were last [node:dev/plugin/schema/computed-attributes:computed], call the [node:dev/plugin/hook/compute-attributes] hook to compute the attributes.

There is no need to check the @willComputeAttributes@ property first; this method only does work if it is actually required.

You only need to call this method when you are working with mutable store objects and are accessing computed attributes.

Returns this store object.


h3(function). computeAttributesForced()

Like @computeAttributesIfRequired()@, but computes attributes even if the object hasn't been marked as requiring an update to computed attributes.

Returns this store object.


h3(function). setWillComputeAttributes(willCompute)

Overrides the normal marking of objects as requiring attributes to be computed.

If @willCompute@ is @true@, attributes will be computed when next required.

If @willCompute@ is @false@, the object will be marked as not requiring attributes to be computed.

Returns this store object.
