--

A JavaScript object implementing the @FormDescription@ interface describes a form, which can be used to create a [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-instance] object to implement a form.


h2. Construction

Use the @[node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/form:form()]@ method on your plugin object.


h2. Interface

h3(property). formId

ID of the form, as in the specification.


h3(property). formTitle

Title of the form from the [node:dev/plugin/form/specification:specification] @formTitle@, with @NAME()@ [node:dev/plugin/form/specification#Text:text translation].


h3(property). specification

The form [node:dev/plugin/form/specification:specification], lazily loaded when specified with a plugin JSON file.


h3(function). instance(document)

Returns a [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-instance] object for using the form with the given @document@.

@document@ is a JSON compatible data structure which contains the data manipulated by the form. Use @{}@ if you want to create a blank form.


h3(function). handle(document, request)

This is a 'shortcut' method which creates a [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-instance] object with the given document, calls the [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-instance#update] function with the given request, and return the form instance object.

Check the @complete@ property on the instance to see if the form was submitted and valid before taking action.

Within a request handler, use @E.request@ as the @request@ argument.
