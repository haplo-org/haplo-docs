A JavaScript object implementing the @Action@ interface represents the rules for deciding whether a given user is permitted to perform an [node:dev/plugin/o/action:action].


h2. Construction

Use [node:dev/plugin/o/action#O_action] while your plugin is loading.


h2. Interface (setup)

Every setup function returns the action object, making them suitable for chaining.


h3(function). title(title)

Specify the name of this action, suitable for displaying to administrative users.


h3(function). allow(kind, thing)

Add an allow rule to the action. A user must match at least one allow rule.

@kind@ specifies which kind of rule. The platform implements two kinds,

|@"all"@|Matches all users|
|@"group"@|The user is a member of the group passed as @thing@|

Plugins can extend the action system to implement other @kind@ options.


h3(function). deny(kind, thing)

Add a deny rule to the action. A user must not match any deny rules.


h2. Interface (utility)

h3(property). code

The API code of this action.


h3(function). enforce(message)

Check to see if the current user is allowed to perform this action, and if not, call [node:dev/plugin/o/request/stop] with the given @message@, or a default message if it is not specified.
