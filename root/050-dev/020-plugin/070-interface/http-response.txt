A JavaScript object implementing the @HTTPResponse@ interface represents the response to an HTTP request made with the [node:dev/plugin/o/http-client].

h2. Construction

When [node:dev/plugin/interface/http-client#request] is called and the callback is invoked, an HTTP response will be passed as the third argument to the callback.

h2. Interface

h3(property). succeesful

Returns true if the request succeeded. If the request failed, see the [node:dev/plugin/interface/http-response#errorMessage] property for the reason why.

h3(property). type

The type of response. This string property will always be @SUCCEEDED@ for a successful response, @FAIL@ for a failed response, and @TEMP_FAIL@ for a response that failed in a way that may get better in future, but did not after several tries.

h3(property). errorMessage

For a failed request, this string property gives a reason for the failure.

h3(property). status

The HTTP status code of the response. This may not be set, if no response could be obtained from the server at all.

h3(property). reason

The HTTP reason message of the response. This may not be set, if no response could be obtained from the server at all.

h3(property). url

For a request that succeeded, the final URL that was requested, incorporating any query parameters added via [node:dev/plugin/interface/http-client#queryParameter]; and if the request was redirected, then this property reflects the URL that was redirected to.

h3(function). singleValueHeader(name, default)

Returns a single-valued HTTP header from the response. @default@, if provided, is returned as a default if the header was not in the response.

h3(property). body

This property contains the body of the reponse, if one was provided, as a [node:dev/plugin/interface/binary-data] object. The filename, content type, and charset will have been filled in from the HTTP response's @Content-Type@ and @Content-Disposition@ headers, if available.
