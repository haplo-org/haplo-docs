title: Interfaces

The API style for JavaScript plugins avoids the use of the @new@ keyword to give greater implementation flexibility, and because it's error-prone. Omitting @new@ is not a syntax error and does something unhelpful.

Instead, 'constructor functions' are defined, mostly in the @O@ global [node:dev/plugin/o/constructor].

These return JavaScript objects which implement interfaces described here. These are roughly equivalent to the JavaScript concept of a prototype.
