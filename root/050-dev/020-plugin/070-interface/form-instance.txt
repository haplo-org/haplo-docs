A JavaScript object implementing the @FormInstance@ interface describes an instance of a form, and is used to display the form, validate the fields, and update a document data structure with the submitted data.


h2. Construction

Use the [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-description#instance:instance(document)] method on a [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-description] object.


h2. Usage

@FormInstance@ objects are created and used for handling a form using data from, and updating data in, the @document@ passed when constructing the object.

These objects are lightweight, and should not be persisted across requests.


h2. Interface

h3(property). complete

@true@ if the form was submitted and all the data is valid, @false@ otherwise.


h3(property). document

The document used to create this instance.


h3(function). update(request)

If the @request@ represents a @POST@ form submission, update the @document@ with the submitted data.

Within a request handler, use @E.request@ as the @request@ argument.

Returns @true@ if the form was submitted and all the data is valid, @false@ otherwise, and updates the @complete@ property.

Unless this function returns @true@, the document *may contain invalid data*.


h3(function). renderForm()

Renders the current state of the form as HTML, for inclusion in a template. This includes data from the current state of the document and error messages.

Behind the scenes, the necessary JavaScript is set to be included in the response.


h3(function). renderDocument()

Renders the document as HTML, using the form description to lay out the fields.


h3(function). choices(name, choices)

Sets instance choices for use by @choice@ elements. This must be called before @update()@ or @renderForm()@.

Use one of the Array formats described in [node:dev/plugin/form/specification/choice#Specifying_the_choice_list].


h3(function). documentWouldValidate()

Returns @true@ if the document would pass validation if rendered as a form and submitted by the user.

You probably won't need to use this function, as you will generally check the @complete@ property after a form has been submitted.


h3(function). makeView()

Returns a copy of the document, with values replaced by display names where appropriate.

If @renderDocument()@ is not suitable for rendering the document, this function can be useful for generating a view for a template, avoiding lots of fiddly code to look up IDs and choices.
