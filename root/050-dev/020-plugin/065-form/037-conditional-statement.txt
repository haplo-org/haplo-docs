title: Conditional statements
--

Conditional statements are used with @required@, @inForm@ and @inDocument@ properties to make them conditional on values in the document.

They may only refer to 1) values which are not modified by this form, or 2) values which are modified by an element which is defined by *before* this element.

Conditional statements are defined using JSON compatible data structures, as functions cannot be serialised into JSON.

The @operation@ property defines what operation is performed.


h2. Equality and inequality

Use the @"==="@ operation to test the value at @path@ for equality with a constant value, and the @"!=="@ operation to test for inequality.

<pre>language=javascript
    {
        path: "path.to.value"
        operation: "===",
        value: 17
    }
</pre>


h2. Defined and undefined values

Use the @"defined"@ and @"not-defined"@ operations to test whether value at @path@ is present in the document.

<pre>language=javascript
    {
        path: "some.value"
        operation: "not-defined"
    }
</pre>


h2. Boolean operators

Use the @"AND"@ and @"OR"@ operations to combine the tests in the @statements@ array. Boolean operations may be nested.

<pre>language=javascript
    {
        operation: "AND",
        statements: [
            {path:"value1", operation:"===", value:24},
            {path:"value2", operation:"defined"}
        ]
    }
</pre>
