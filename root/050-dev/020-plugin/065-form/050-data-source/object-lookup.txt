title: object-lookup
--

A @"object-lookup"@ data source for all [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object:store objects] of a given set of types, subject to the current user's permissions.

The ID is the @ref@ of the store object, as a string, and the display name is the title of the object.

The @definition@ is a single [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref], or an Array of Refs to define a set of types. Use the [node:dev/plugin/schema/schema-global/type] constants.

To create a data source which looks up all people and organisation objects in the store:

<pre>language=javascript
    P.dataSource("people_and_orgs", "object-lookup", [
        T.Person, T.Organisation
    ]);
</pre>
