The @"oforms:table"@ and @"oforms:table:display"@ templates display the enclosed form elements within an HTML table.

If you use it for a section, you'll get a single row. You might want to use the [node:dev/plugin/form/form-template/oforms-grid] template instead.

If used for a repeating section, it'll edit tabular data, allowing the user to add and remove rows.
