title: Value path handling

h2. Values and documents

Each form element gets and sets a value in the JSON _document_. The @path@ property in the _specification_ defines where it goes in the _document_.

The @path@ is a @"."@ separated list of property names. For example, in this document,

<pre>language=json
{
    "name": "Joe Bloggs",
    "info": {
        "age": 35,
        "favouriteColour": "Green"
    }
}
</pre>

a @path@ of @"info.age"@ would refer to the value @35@.

When defining nested data structures, you don't have to ensure that the all the nested objects exist. When getting a value, if a containing section doesn't exist, the value will be treated as not existing in the document, and when setting a value, missing nested sections are automatically created.

This means you can safely use the empty document of @{}@ to output a form using the default values for every form element, and to receive the data from a submitted form.


h2. Context

The @path@ property does not necessarily refer to a path from the root of the _document_. It's actually relative to the current _context_.

At the root of the _specification_, the _context_ is the root of the _document_. However, the context may change when you define a [node:dev/plugin/form/specification/section].

If the @path@ property is defined for a Section, then the context is moved to that value. For example, in the above document, if there was a Section with a @path@ of @"info"@, then form elements enclosed in that Section would refer to the @age@ property with a @path@ of @"age"@.


h2. Repeating sections

Repeating sections work slightly differently, because they need to create an Array of all the repeats. A @path@ must be specified for a [node:dev/plugin/form/specification/repeating-section], and this refers to an array in the _document_.

The _context_ for the elements in a repeating section is each entry in the array.

For example, here's a document containing information about multiple people.

<pre>language=json
{
    "people": [
        {
            "name": "Joe Bloggs",
            "info": {
                "age": 35,
                "favouriteColour": "Green"
            },
        },
        {
            "name": "Jane Bloggs",
            "info": {
                "age": 34,
                "favouriteColour": "Purple"
            }
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

The @path@ of the repeating section is @"people"@, and a form element editing the age of each person would use a @path@ of @"info.age"@.


h3. Arrays of values

If you just want to have one element in your repeating section, for example, to allow multiple phone numbers, then forcing the values to be enclosed in an object with a single property may make your _document_ a little annoying to handle.

There is a special case which cleans this up. If there is just one form element in a repeating section, it may use the special @path@ of @"."@. When used, this will mean the array is a simple array of values.

For example, the telephone numbers in this document

<pre>language=json
{
    "name": "Joe Bloggs",
    "info": {
        "age": 35,
        "favouriteColour": "Green",
        "telephoneNumbers": [
            "+44 20 7047 1111",
            "+44 7777 123456"
        ]
    }
}
</pre>

could be edited by using a repeating section with a @path@ of @"info.telephoneNumbers"@ which contains a single element with a @path@ of @"."@.
