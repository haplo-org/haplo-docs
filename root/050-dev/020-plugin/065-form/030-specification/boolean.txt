title: Boolean
--

A boolean @true@ or @false@ value, as radio buttons or a checkbox.

When the form is rendered as a document, the @trueLabel@ and @falseLabel@ will be used to represent the underlying boolean value.


h2. Properties

|@type@|@"boolean"@|
|@trueLabel@|(optional) Label for the @true@ value. Defaults to @"Yes"@.|
|@falseLabel@|(optional) Label for the @false@ value. Defaults to @"No"@.|
|@style@|(optional) Style of element. Defaults to @"radio"@.|
|@notConfirmedMessage@|(optional) For @"confirm"@ style elements, the error message to display when the box is not checked.|

All the [node:dev/plugin/form/specification#Common_properties:common properties] are supported.


h3. Style options

The @style@ property can be set to:

|@"radio"@|Use two HTML @<input type="radio">@ elements, labelled with the @trueLabel@ and @falseLabel@|
|@"checkbox"@|Use an HTML @<input type="checkbox">@ element, followed by the @label@ of the Element.|
|@"confirm"@|As @"checkbox"@, but requires that the checkbox is checked by the user to pass validation.|

Note that use of the @"checkbox"@ style means that the value in the Document will always be @true@ or @false@. The @"radio"@ style allows for no answer to be given, in which case the value will be omitted from the Document.

When you're using @"checkbox"@ or @"confirm"@ style elements, consider setting @trueLabel@ if you are rendering it as a document. This will avoid the field being rendered as just "Yes".


h3. Confirmation boxes

For the best user experience, a @style:"confirm"@ confirmation box should include the @notConfirmedMessage@ and @trueLabel@ properties. For example:

<pre>language=javascript
    {
        type: "boolean",
        style: "confirm",
        path: "termsAndConditions"
        label: "I reluctantly agree to the terms and conditions.",
        notConfirmedMessage:
                "You must agree to the terms and conditions before continuing",
        trueLabel: "You have agreed to terms and conditions."
    }
</pre>
