title: Repeating section
--

Repeating sections allow groups of form elements to be repeated in the form. The user can add and remove the repetitions as required. This allows editing of tabular data to be implemented trivially, along with things like multiple email addresses and phone numbers in forms.

They can be nested to whatever depth is required.

The value in the _document_ is an Array containing zero or more _rows_. A row is an object containing properties defined by the form elements in the @elements@ property, unless there is only one element with a special @path@ of @"."@, in which case it's an array of the raw values.

See [node:dev/plugin/form/value-path#Repeating_sections:path handling for repeating sections] for details of how the @path@ is used.
