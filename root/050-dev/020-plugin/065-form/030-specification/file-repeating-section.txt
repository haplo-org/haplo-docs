title: File repeating section
--

A file repeating section works exactly like a normal repeating section, except it displays the file drag and drop upload interface, and will automatically add repetitions as files are uploaded.

h2. Properties

|@type@|@"file-repeating-section"@|

All the [node:dev/plugin/form/specification#Common_properties:common properties] are supported, along with the properties of [node:dev/plugin/form/specification/repeating-section:repeating sections].


h2. Suggested usage

To upload multiple files, and ask for additional information about each file, use:

<pre>language=javascript
{
    type: "file-repeating-section",
    path: "filesWithDescription",
    heading: "Files with description",
    allowDelete: true,
    elements: [
        {type:"text", path:"description", label:"Description", required:true},
        {type:"file", path:"file", required:true}
    ]
}
</pre>

To upload a simple set of files, with minimal user interface:

<pre>language=javascript
{
    type: "file-repeating-section",
    path: "fileSet",
    heading: "Set of files",
    allowAdd: false,
    allowDelete: false,
    elements: [
        {type:"file", path:"."}
    ]
}
</pre>

In the document, the @fileSet@ property will be an array of file values.
