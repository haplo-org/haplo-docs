title: Lookup
--

A field implemented as an HTML @<input type="text">@ element which autocompletes against a server-side list. This list is defined by a [node:dev/plugin/form/data-source:data source], which provides entries on demand.

Each entry in the list has an ID, which is the value stored in the document, and a display name, which is displayed to the user. The data source maps an ID to display name on the server side when rendering the document.
