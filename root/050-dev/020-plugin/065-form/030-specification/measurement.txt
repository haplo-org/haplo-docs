title: Measurement
--

A number, with units. Optionally converted to a 'canonical' unit for ease of processing.

The value stored in the document as an object with properties:

|@value@|The numeric value|
|@units@|The units of the measurement|

If @includeCanonical@ is @true@, then this object will include the measurement converted to the canonical units, with the unit name as property name.

For example, given a length measurement with a @path@ of @"height"@ and using @includeCanonical@, a document might look like:

<pre>language=json
{
    "name": "Joe Bloggs",
    "height": {
        "value": 6,
        "units": "ft",
        "m": 1.8288
    }
}
</pre>
