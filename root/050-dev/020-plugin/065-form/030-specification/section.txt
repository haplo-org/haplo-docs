title: Section
--

A section groups together a number of other form elements. They can be used to render part of the form using a different template, and avoid the need of the enclosed elements to have long @path@ properties by moving the 'context' deeper into the _document_.

See [node:dev/plugin/form/value-path] for details.


h2. Properties

|@type@|@"section"@|
|@elements@|An array of other form element specifications.|
|@template@|(optional) The [node:dev/plugin/form/form-template:template] to use for rendering this section. Defaults to @"oforms:default"@|
|@templateDisplay@|(optional) The template to use for rendering the document. Defaults to the name specified for @template@ with @":display"@ appended.|
|@templateOptions@|(optional) Options for the specified template. Ignored by this element, but is available to the template for it to change its behaviour.|
|@renderDocumentOmitEmpty@|(optional) If true, when rendering the document with [node:dev/plugin/interface/form-instance#renderDocument], omit any elements which do not have a value in the document. If no elements have a value, omit the section entirely.|
|@heading@|(optional) A heading to display above this section in forms and documents.|
|@path@|(optional) @"path"@ is optional for Sections, and moves the _context_ for the enclosed form elements.|


h3. Heading and labels

Sections have two similar properties, @label@ and @heading@.

@label@ is one of the common properties for an element specification. Using a @label@ will render the label as it would any other field, which may not be as prominent as you'd like.

In most cases, you should use a @heading@ property and not use a @label@, so the heading will be rendered as a proper section heading.

However, you'd use a @label@ if the section is nested within another section using the @oforms:table@ template, where the label is used for the column headings.
