title: hElementDiscover
class: HookNode
--

This hook is used to list all the available Elements provided by the currently installed plugins.

You shouldn't use this hook directly. Use the default implementation provided by the JavaScript Plugin object. See [node:dev/plugin/elements] for details.

A plugin should append to the @elements@ array, being careful not to remove any entries added by other plugins. For example,

<pre>language=javascript
P.hook('hElementDiscover', function(response) {
    response.elements.push(
        ["example_plugin:test", "Example Test Element"]
    );
});
</pre>
