Hooks allow plugins to change the behaviour of the Haplo application.

To respond to a hook, a function is registered with the plugin object using the [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/platform-interface#hook] function. The documentation for each hook gives you an example.

The first argument of the hook function is the @response@ object. The documentation for each hook defines the properties of this object, and the function responds to the hook by changing or setting those properties.

Other arguments to the function are defined for each hook to pass in relevant data.

A hook may be called in "request context" when a request is being handled. Information about the request, such as [node:dev/plugin/o/request/current-user] is available.
