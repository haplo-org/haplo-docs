title: hElementRender
class: HookNode
--

Render an Element as HTML for inclusion into a web page.

You shouldn't use this hook directly. Use the default implementation provided by the JavaScript Plugin object. See [node:dev/plugin/elements] for details.

If you implement this hook directly, you should test the @name@ argument, and if it matches an element you implement, generate the HTML and title.

The @options@ are not decoded, and are passed as Strings. By convention these are in [node:dev/plugin/standard-interfaces/json:JSON format].
