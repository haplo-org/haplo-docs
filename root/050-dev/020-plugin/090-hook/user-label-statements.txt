title: hUserLabelStatements
class: HookNode
--

Allows a plugin to augment or completely rewrite the label statements which represent the permissions of a user.

Called with the SYSTEM user active, so the plugin will have a consistent view of the store and full permissions. Do not call @O.impersonate()@ when responding to this hook.

When implementing custom permissions, you *must* call [node:dev/plugin/o/invalidation#O_reloadUserPermissions] whenever the underlying information changes.
