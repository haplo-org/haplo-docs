title: hNavigationPosition
class: HookNode
--

Called to add entries in the left hand navigation for logged in users. The navigation should be generated for [node:dev/plugin/o/request/current-user].

The @name@ is the position name configured in the Navigation using the System management user interface.

Navigation is aggressively cached, and this hook will only be called occasionally for any given user. Call [node:dev/plugin/o/invalidation#O_reloadNavigation] to invalidate the cache.
