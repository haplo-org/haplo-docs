title: hScheduleDailyEarly
class: HookNode
--

Called every day, early in the morning.

You should not rely on this hook being called only once each day, or that it'll be called at any specific time.

To perform a task on a specific date, or only on some days of the week, test the @year@, @month@, @dayOfMonth@, and @dayOfWeek@ arguments before performing the task.
