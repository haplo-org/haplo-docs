Modify the object display page by adding extra user interface which provides access to the functionality of your plugin.

Use the @backLink@ and @backLinkText@ responses with caution. Note their names are to match view rendering, and not indicative of their purpose. Because users are expected to browse through the objects in an explorative and unguided manner, there is no real concept of 'back'.

You should only use @backLink@ where there is a obvious object that the user is likely to visit next. You should set the @backLinkText@ to a noun which describes where the link goes. For example, if a file was considered 'attached' to a project, you might link to the project object with the text "Project".

Use [node:dev/plugin/elements] to add additional information and user interface to an object.
