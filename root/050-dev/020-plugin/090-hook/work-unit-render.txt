title: hWorkUnitRender
class: HookNode
--

Render a work unit as HTML for a given context.

You probably shouldn't use this hook directly. Use the default implementation provided by the JavaScript Plugin object. See [node:dev/plugin/work-flow] for details.

If you implement this hook directly, you should test the WorkUnit's [node:dev/plugin/interface/work-unit#workType] property, and if it matches a work unit you implement, generate the HTML.

The values for @context@ are documented in the [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin-work-unit-renderer#context] property of the @PluginWorkUnitRenderer@ interface.
