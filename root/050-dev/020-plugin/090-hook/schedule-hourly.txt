title: hScheduleHourly
class: HookNode
--

Called every hour to allow plugins to perform timed actions.

You should not rely on this hook being called only once each hour, or that it'll be called at any specific minutes past the hour.

If possible, use one of the @hSecheduleDaily*@ hooks, to avoid unnecessary calls to your plugin. 

To perform a task at a specific time, on a specific date, or only on some days of the week, test the @year@, @month@, @dayOfMonth@, @hour@, and @dayOfWeek@ arguments before performing the task.
