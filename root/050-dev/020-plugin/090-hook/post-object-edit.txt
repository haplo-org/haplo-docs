title: hPostObjectEdit
class: HookNode
--

This hook allows a plugin to observe or alter an object which has been edited by the user, and redirect them to an alternative page after the edit operation.

The @replacementObject@ must be created using [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object#mutableCopy] of the given @object@.

hPostObjectEdit is called before [node:dev/plugin/hook/label-object] or [node:dev/plugin/hook/label-updated-object].
