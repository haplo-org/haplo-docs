title: hPreObjectDisplay
class: HookNode
--

This hook allows a plugin to modify an object before it is displayed. The most appropriate use is to remove information which the user should not be able to see, and only when they do not have permission to edit that object.

Adding adding or changing attributes is likely to confuse the user. Consider using an [node:dev/plugin/elements:Element] instead to display additional information by the side of the object.

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object] passed to the hook is read only. @mutableCopy()@ should be used to make a copy, which is then modified. To work well with other plugins, start with an existing replacement object if one already exists. For example:

<pre>language=javascript
P.hook('hPreObjectDisplay', function(response, object) {
    var r = response.replacementObject || object.mutableCopy();
    // modify r
    response.replacementObject = r;
});
</pre>
