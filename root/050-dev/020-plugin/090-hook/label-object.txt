title: hLabelObject
class: HookNode
--

Apply Labels to a newly created object, by adding or removing labels using a [node:dev/plugin/interface/label-changes] object passed to the hook function.

The Platform applies the configured Labels after this hook has been called. To remove default labels, use @remove()@ on the @LabelChanges@ to add them to the list of labels which shouldn't be applied.

There's also another hook, [node:dev/plugin/hook/label-updated-object], for re-labelling updated objects. This is a separate hook to encourage a practise of only labelling objects on creation.

See also [node:dev/plugin/hook/labelling-user-interface] for presenting UI in the editor for labelling objects.
