title: hPreIndexObject
class: HookNode
--

This hook allows a plugin to modify attributes before an object is indexed.

This should only be used in very special cases, and generally only by plugins providing features to other plugins.

Use [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object#reindexText] to reindex the text on an object if your plugin adds some text to an object for indexing, and it's changed without the object having been updated.

The [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-object] passed to the hook is read only. @mutableCopy()@ should be used to make a copy, which is then modified. To work well with other plugins, start with an existing replacement object if one already exists, following the example below.

This hook will be called several times for each object update.

h3. Example

This example hook adds additional text to the notes field for File objects.

<pre>language=javascript
P.hook('hPreObjectIndex', function(response, object) {
    if(object.isKindOf(T.File)) {
        var r = response.replacementObject || object.mutableCopy();
        r.append("notes ...", A_NOTES);
        response.replacementObject = r;
    }
});
</pre>
