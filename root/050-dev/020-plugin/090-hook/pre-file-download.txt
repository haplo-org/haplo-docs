title: hPreFileDownload
class: HookNode
--

This hook allows plugins to observe file downloads. It is called for file downloads and requests for thumbnail images, both from the normal platform interface and from the [node:dev/standard-plugin/web-publisher:web publisher].

When observing file downloads, at the very least, your plugin should check the @isThumbnail@ and @transform@ arguments to make sure you are observing the right thing. You might also need to check the @isWebPublisher@ argument.

This hook should *not* be used to implement access control or security restrictions.

This hook may not be called if the file can be served from the browser's cache.

If the plugin sets the @redirectPath@ response property, the file download will not be audited.
