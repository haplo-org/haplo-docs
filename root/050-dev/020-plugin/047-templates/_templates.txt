h2. Haplo Safe View Templates

Haplo plugins use HSVT templates to render their user interface. Templates are usually rendered when responding to an [node:dev/plugin/request-handling:HTTP request].

HSVT is designed to be a safe templating language which cannot output invalid HTML and prevents security flaws like XSS. It does this by understanding the structure of HTML, and always applies the correct escaping.

It's also designed to make generating HTML as simple and easy as possible. Tasks like URL generation and conditionally includes tag class attributes is handled by HSVT.

HSVT has a [node:dev/plugin/templates/hsvt-language:simple structure] made up of view property names which insert values from the view, HTML tags, literal strings, and template functions.

Template functions implement control flow, rendering of commit HTML widgets, and include additional templates.


h2. Directory layout

Templates are stored in the @template@ (singular) directory as files with the @.hsvt@ extension. See [node:dev/plugin/directory-structure].

To get a [node:dev/plugin/interface/template] object to use for rendering, call [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/response-generation#template] on your [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin] object. The name is the name of the file (without the extension) within the @template@ directory, or one of a standard template beginning @std:@.

The kind of template, available in the [node:dev/plugin/interface/template#kind] property of the @Template@ object, is derived from the extension of the template file. This will be used to set the MIME type of the response when rendered with the [node:dev/plugin/interface/exchange#render] function of [node:dev/plugin/interface/exchange].

To produce the output from the template as a @String@, call [node:dev/plugin/interface/template#render] on the @Template@ object, passing in a view object.
