long_title: File template functions
--

These template functions render files in a standardised manner.

All functions take optional options as string arguments. Options can be @"asFullURL"@, @"authenticationSignature"@ and @"forceDownload"@, matching the meanings of the [node:dev/plugin/interface/file#Options:options for File's toHTML() function].

To render a file with a thumbnail and filename, use an authentication signature, and force it to be a download, use

<pre>language=hsvt
std:file(file "authenticationSignature" "forceDownload")
</pre>

Either a @File@ or a @FileIdentifier@ can be passed to the template functions. If the latter, the filename of the identifier will be displayed.


h2. std:file(file [options])

Render a file with a thumbnail and filename, linking to the download.


h2. std:file:thumbnail(file [options])

Render a file as a thumbnail only, linking to the download.


h2. std:file:link(file [options])

Render a simple link to a file.


h2. std:file:transform(file transform [options])

Like @std:file()@, but a file transform is specified for the link.


h2. std:file:with-link-url(file url ["authenticationSignature"])

Renders the same as the @std:file()@ template, but the download links to the supplied @url@, not the platform default. The only valid option to pass to this function is @authenticationSignature@, others will be silently ignored.

@url@ should be generated using an HSVT [node:dev/plugin/templates/urls:url()] function, to ensure proper formatting.

This template should only be used if your plugin is implementing its own file download handler.


h2. std:file:thumbnail:with-link-url(file url ["authenticationSignature"])

Renders the same as the @std:file:thumblnail()@ template, but the download links to the supplied @url@, not the platform default. The only valid option to pass to this function is @authenticationSignature@, others will be silently ignored.

@url@ should be generated using an HSVT [node:dev/plugin/templates/urls:url()] function, to ensure proper formatting.

This template should only be used if your plugin is implementing its own file download handler.
