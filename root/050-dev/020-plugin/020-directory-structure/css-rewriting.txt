title: CSS rewriting
--

CSS files in the plugin @static@ directory are rewritten slightly to reflect the application.

Most useful is @PLUGIN_STATIC_PATH@, which is rewritten to the path where the other static files are served. This allows you to use images within your CSS.

Replacements made are:

|*String*|*Replaced with*|*Example*|
|@PLUGIN_STATIC_PATH@|Public path of the static files, as the plugin [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/response-generation#staticDirectoryUrl] property|@/~123/x@|
|@APPLICATION_COLOUR_MAIN@|Configured application main colour|@#000077@|
|@APPLICATION_COLOUR_SECONDARY@|Configured application secondary colour|@#0000ff@|
|@APPLICATION_COLOUR_HIGHLIGHT@|Configured application highlight colour|@#ff0000@|
