title: Service user
--

@service-user@ declarations define service users, which are then used with [node:dev/plugin/o/permissions#O_impersonating] within API services to set permissions for those operations. By convention, Service users are created in a pair with a @group@. Permissions are then set on the group, rather than the service user directly, so the conventions in the code match those for normal users.
