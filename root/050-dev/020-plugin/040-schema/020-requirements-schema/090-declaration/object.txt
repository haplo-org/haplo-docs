title: Object
--

@object@ declarations define a generic object with a given type, and a configured behaviour attribute as the given API code. They're used to set up the default members of a [node:setup/lists:list].

You cannot use @as@ readable names on @object@ declarations. Use the normal store object API, or the [node:dev/plugin/o/behaviour] API.

This declaration ensures that there is a 'Red' member of the given list, with a configured behaviour attribute of @"example:list:colours:red"@.
