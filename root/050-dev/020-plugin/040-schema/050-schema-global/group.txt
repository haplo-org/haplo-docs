For each active user group in the application, an entry will be defined in the @SCHEMA.GROUP@ dictionary for the group's API code. The value is the ID of the user group, which can be used with [node:dev/plugin/o/lookup/group] to load the group information object.

For example, @GROUP["std:group:administrators"]@ is the built-in Administrators group.

To make your code easier to read, you should use [node:dev/plugin/schema/local-schema:plugin local schema dictionaries].
