For each type defined in the application's schema, an entry be defined in the @SCHEMA.TYPE@ dictionary for the type's API code.

The value of the constant is a [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref], although loading the object it refers to is unlikely to be useful.

For example, @TYPE["std:type:book"]@ is the ref of the standard Book type.

To make your code easier to read, you should use [node:dev/plugin/schema/local-schema:plugin local schema dictionaries].
