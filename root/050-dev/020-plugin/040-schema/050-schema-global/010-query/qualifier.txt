title: Qualifier queries
--

Plugins can query the schema to find out more information about the qualifiers defined in the current application.


h2. Schema query

h3(function). SCHEMA.getQualifierInfo(qualifier)

Returns a JavaScript object with properties describing the qualifier, described below.

@qualifier@ must be one of the [node:dev/plugin/schema/schema-global/qual] properties. You should not rely on the exact underlying type of this value in your code.


h2. Info properties

Each qualifier information object contains the following keys:


h3(key). name

The name of the qualifier, suitable for displaying to the user.


h3(key). code

The API code for the qualifier, eg @"dc:qualifier:alternative"@. May be @undefined@ if the qualifier does not have an API code.


h3(key). shortName

The short name, or "search name", of the qualifier. Used in search constraints.
