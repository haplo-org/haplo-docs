title: Type queries
--

Plugins can query the schema to find out more information about the types defined in the current application.


h2. Schema query

h3(function). SCHEMA.getTypeInfo(type)

Returns a JavaScript object with properties describing the type, described below.

@type@ is a [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] object which refers to the type. Use the [node:dev/plugin/schema/schema-global/type] properties.


h2. Info properties

Each type information object contains the following keys:


h3(key). name

The name of the type, suitable for displaying to the user.


h3(key). code

The API code for the type, eg @"std:type:person"@. May be @undefined@ if the type does not have an API code.


h3(key). shortName

The short name, or "search name", of the type. Used in search constraints.


h3(key). parentType

The @Ref@ of the parent type, or @undefined@ if this is a root type.


h3(key). rootType

The @Ref@ of the root type, which may be equal to the requested type if it is a root type.


h3(key). childTypes

An @Array@ of @Refs@ of the direct child types of this type. If a type has no direct child types, the array will be empty.


h3(key). attributes

An array of attribute descriptors, in the order that the attributes should be displayed in the user interface. Each matches an [node:dev/plugin/schema/schema-global/attr] constant.

Where the application uses an aliased attribute, the descriptor of the underlying attribute is included in this array.
