title: Legacy Handlebars support
--

As well as [node:dev/plugin/templates:HSVT templates], Haplo also supports legacy "Handlebars":http://handlebarsjs.com/ templates. Templates have a @.html@ file extension.

Handlebars and HSVT templates can be seamlessly mixed in a plugin.

You should *not* use Handlebars for new plugins, and Handlebars support will be removed from a future version of the platform. This documentation is to support existing Haplo plugins.

Handlebars partials are automatically supported, and can refer to plugin templates, [node:dev/plugin/templates/std-template:standard templates], or the [node:dev/plugin/misc/handlebars/std-template:legacy Handlebars standard templates].

Some [node:dev/plugin/misc/handlebars/std-helper:handlebars helpers] are provided.


h2. Plugin Handlebars helpers

[node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin:Plugin objects] implement a function to register a custom Handlebars helper for your templates.

h3(function). registerHandlebarsHelper(name, helperFunction)

Register a Handlebars helper function, making it available to all the templates rendered by this plugin.
