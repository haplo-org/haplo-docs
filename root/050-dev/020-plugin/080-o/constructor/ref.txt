title: O.ref()
link_as: keyword
--

Constructs a object implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] interface.

There are two options for calling it:


h3(function). O.ref(string)

Decode the presentation string representation of a object reference.

Returns @null@ if the string is not a valid object reference.


h3(function). O.ref(objId)

Create a reference object using object ID.

This isn't likely to be terribly useful, as most Ref objects are constructed for you by the API.


h2. Other argument types

If a [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] object is passed as the first argument, that object will be returned from the function.

If @undefined@ or @null@ is passed as the first argument, @null@ will be returned from the function.

An exception will be thrown if any other type of object passed to @O.ref()@.
