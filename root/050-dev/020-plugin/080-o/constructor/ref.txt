title: O.ref()
link_as: keyword
--

Constructs a object implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] interface.

There are two options for calling it:


h3(function). O.ref(string)

Decode the presentation string representation of a object reference.

Returns @null@ if the string does not match the format of a valid object reference.

Note that the returned reference may not refer to an object which actually exists, or the current user may not necessarily have permission to read it, so calling @load()@ on this @Ref@ is not guaranteed to be able to return an @Object@.


h3(function). O.ref(objId)

Create a reference object using object ID.

This isn't likely to be terribly useful, as most Ref objects are constructed for you by the API.


h2. Other argument types

If a [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref] object is passed as the first argument, that object will be returned from the function.

If @undefined@ or @null@ is passed as the first argument, @null@ will be returned from the function.

An exception will be thrown if any other type of object passed to @O.ref()@.
