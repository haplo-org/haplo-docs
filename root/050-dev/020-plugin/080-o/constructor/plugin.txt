title: O.plugin()

Constructs and registers a plugin. See [node:dev/plugin/implement-plugin].


h3(function). O.plugin(pluginName)

Implement and register a plugin. The @pluginName@ must exactly match the plugin that is being loaded.

Returns an object implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin] interface.

Unless you include a [node:dev/plugin/directory-structure#global_js] file, the call to @O.plugin()@ is automatically generated by the platform and you must not include it in your implementation files.

This function must only be called once. Calling it more than once, or in any other context, will throw an exception.
