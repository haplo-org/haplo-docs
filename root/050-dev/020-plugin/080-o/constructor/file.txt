title: O.file()
link_as: keyword
--

Constructs a object implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/file] interface.

If it is necessary to add the file to the file store, it will be added and committed before the @O.file()@ function returns. If the same file is added twice, only one copy will be stored, and it will retain the original filename.

If the requested file cannot be retrieved or added to the file store, an exception will be thrown.


h3(function). O.file(file)

If a [node:dev/plugin/interface/file] is passed as an argument, the exact same object will be returned.


h3(function). O.file(fileIdentifier)

If a [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-identifier] is passed as an argument, the @File@ it references will be returned from the file store.


h3(function). O.file(uploadedFile)

An [node:dev/plugin/interface/uploaded-file] will be added to the file store, then a @File@ object returned after committing the file to the file store.


h3(function). O.file(digest, fileSize)

Look up a @File@ by @digest@ and optional @fileSize@.


h3(function). O.file(object)

Look up a @File@ by properties on the @object@ passed as an argument. @object.digest@ must be a string, and the optional @object.fileSize@ must be a number.
