title: O.query()
link_as: keyword
--

Constructs a object implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-query] interface.

There are two options for calling it:


h3(function). O.query()

Returns a blank [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-query] object, ready for the query to be generated programmatically.


h3(function). O.query(string)

Returns a [node:dev/plugin/interface/store-query] object generated by parsing the string as a query, exactly the same as a query in the Haplo user interface.

See the in-application help for details on the query syntax.
