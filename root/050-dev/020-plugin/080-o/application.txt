title: Application information
--

Basic information about the current application. Your plugin can use this to identify the application and generate URLs.


h3(property). O.application.id

The numeric application ID.


h3(property). O.application.name

The human readable name of this application, typically the name of the organisation using it.


h3(property). O.application.hostname

The hostname of the application.


h3(property). O.application.url

The base URL of the application, including the protocol. The returned string does not include a trailing @/@ character.


h3(property). O.application.config

The configuration data for this application, editable in System Management as a JSON document.

The properties of this object will not change after your plugin has been loaded. If the administrator edits the configuration data, the plugins are reloaded into a new JavaScript runtime. Therefore, you can safely use the contents of this document to change how things like request handlers and forms are declared.
