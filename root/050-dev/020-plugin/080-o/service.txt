title: Services
--

Services are used to implement [node:dev/plugin/misc/inter-plugin-comms:inter-plugin communication], and are registered with [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/platform-interface#implementService].


h3(function). O.service(name, arg1, arg2, ...)

Call the registered service called @name@. Further arguments are optional, and if given, will be passed to the service function.

If more than one service function is registered, they will all be called in the order of registration until one of the functions returns a value which is not @undefined@.

@O.service()@ returns the value returned from the service function, so results can easily by returned from a service.


h3(function). O.serviceImplemented(name)

Returns @true@ if there is at least one function registered to implement a service called @name@.
