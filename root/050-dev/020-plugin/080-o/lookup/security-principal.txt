title: O.securityPrincipal()
link_as: keyword
--

Look up a user or group, given an ID, and return an object implementing the [node:dev/plugin/interface/security-principal] interface.

Unlike [node:dev/plugin/o/lookup/user] and [node:dev/plugin/o/lookup/group], this function does not perform a type check on the returned object, so can be used where an ID may refer to a group or a user. This can be useful when working with [node:dev/plugin/interface/work-unit] objects which can be actioned by a user or a group.


h3(function). O.securityPrincipal(principalId)

Look up the security principal with this ID. An exception will be thrown if the principal does not exist.


h3(function). O.securityPrincipal(ref)

Look up the security principal with the @ref@ property set to this [node:dev/plugin/interface/ref].

@null@ will be returned if no such principal exists.

If more than one principal has this @ref@, your code should not rely on which one is returned.
