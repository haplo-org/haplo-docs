title: Features
--

Features are an alternative to [node:dev/plugin/o/service], and are implemented with [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin/platform-interface#provideFeature].


h3(function). O.featureImplemented(name)

Returns @true@ if a feature called @name@ is provided by an installed plugin.

If called when a plugin is being loaded, and the [node:dev/plugin/plugin-json#loadPriority] of the providing plugin is less than that of this plugin, then @false@ will be returned because the feature has not yet been provided.
