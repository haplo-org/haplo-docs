title: Assertions
--

Assertions are used to make statements about the expected behaviour of the plugin under test.

To pass, a test must run without throwing any exceptions and with all assertions passing.


h3(function). t.assert(condition, message)

Call @t.assert()@ to make an assertion in your test.

@condition@ must be true, otherwise the assertion has failed and the test will be aborted.

@message@ is optional, and if passed, will be included in the assertion failure message.


h2. Using assertions

Assertions in your tests will look something like this:

<pre>language=javascript
t.assert(a === "Value");
t.assert(b === 42, "Meaning of life");
</pre>

The first makes a simple statement that a variable should have the correct value. The second is similar, but includes a @message@ to explain what is being tested to someone reading the test and in any failure message.
