This file transform step converts a file to a different file format.

It is not possible to convert between all formats, but most useful conversions are supported. You're always pretty safe converting to PDF with the @application/pdf@ MIME type.

You can safely use the std:convert step to ensure a file is in the right format. If a file is already in the requested format, and no options are specified, then the input file will be renamed to the output without any conversion taking place.

If additional platform components are installed, additional conversions may be available.
