This transform step overlaps two PDF files, and can be used to add letterheads to generated documents or apply watermarks.

*NOTE:* This transform is implemented by an optional platform component, and may not be available in your installation.


h2. Transform specification

h3(property). input

Name of the input file. Optional, defaults to @"input"@.


h3(property). output

Name of the output file. Optional, defaults to @"output"@.


h3(property). overlay

Name of the PDF file which will be overlaid on the @input@ file. Required.

If you're not sure your overlay file will be a PDF, you can use a [node:dev/plugin/files/transform/convert] step to make sure it's a PDF. If the file is already a PDF, it won't do anything.

<pre>language=javascript
pipeline.transform("std:convert",
  {input:"overlay", output:"overlay", mimeType:"application/pdf"});
</pre>


h3(property). background

If @true@, the @overlay@ file will be in the background of the @input@ file. Optional, defaults to @true@.


h3(property). firstPage

The first page of the @input@ file to modify. Optional, defaults to @1@.


h3(property). lastPage

The last page of the @input@ file to modify. Optional, defaults to the length of the @input@ document.
