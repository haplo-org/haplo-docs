This file transform step does not perform any file processing, just renames files in the file transform pipeline's file list.

You should probably use [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-pipeline#rename] and [node:dev/plugin/interface/file-transform-pipeline#transformPreviousOutput] instead.


h2. Transform specification

h3(property). rename

An array of ["from", "to"] arrays specifying the renames.

Renames are performed in a single atomic step, so this specification will swap @file-a@ and @file-b@.

<pre>language=json
{
    rename: [
        ["file-a", "file-b"],
        ["file-b", "file-a"]
    ]
}
</pre>
