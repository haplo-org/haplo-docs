title: Working with databases
--

The Haplo Platform provides a [node:dev/plugin/database:relational database] for plugins, with the tables defined in JavaScript.

Currently migration of database schemas is not available, so you need to reset the database whenever you change a table definition.


h2. Resetting a database

When you've made changes to the table definitions in your plugin, save the file and let the Plugin Tool upload the new definitions to the server.

To apply the changes, reset the database:

<pre>
    haplo-plugin reset-db
</pre>

This will delete the old tables for your plugin, and recreate them with the current definitions. *All the data in the tables will be deleted.*

You don't have to stop another instance of the Plugin Tool waiting to upload changes when you run this command.


h2. Test data

If you need some test data, the best way is to create a temporary [node:dev/plugin/request-handling:request handler] which creates it. After you've reset the database, request the URL in your web browser to populate the new database tables.

Alternatively, you can define an @onInstall()@ function in your [node:dev/plugin/interface/plugin] definition. This will be called when you reset the database, and every time the Plugin Tool uploads a new file to the server.

Remember to remove this test data when you submit the plugin.


h2. Future developments

Planned development includes:

 * Automatic table migration
 * Test data loader
