title: Installation (UNIX or OS X)
--

On Mac OS X and UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux, you have a choice of using an automatic installer script (if you're not using JRuby for anything else), or manual installation.

h2. Automatic installation

h3. Check Java is installed

To check Java is installed, in a Terminal window, type @java -version@

You must use Java 8. The version number will be shown as '1.8'. (Later versions of Java will be supported when the JRuby runtime is compatible.)

If you get an error, or need to update to Java 8, download "Java":https://java.com and install it in the default folder. Repeat the @java -version@ command to check it installed correctly.

If you are using a Linux system, your package manager should be able to install Java 8 for you.

h3. Run the automatic installation script

Open a new Terminal window and download the "@haplo_plugin_install.sh@":https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haplo-org/haplo-plugin-tool/master/install/haplo_plugin_install.sh installation script:

<pre>
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haplo-org/haplo-plugin-tool/master/install/haplo_plugin_install.sh
</pre>

Before executing the script, review the contents in your text editor of choice. The script downloads the binary release of JRuby into @~/haplo-dev-support/haplo-plugin@ , installs the @haplo@ ruby gem, and appends the new @jruby/bin@ directory to your PATH by adding a line to the @~/.profile@ of your current user.

To install, run the script with:

<pre>
    sh haplo_plugin_install.sh
</pre>

After installation, open a new Terminal window or run @source ~/.profile@ and type:

<pre>
    haplo-plugin --help
</pre>

to ensure installation was successful.

If you receive a _command not found_ error check the output of @echo $PATH@ . It should contain the @jruby/bin@ directory from the @haplo-dev-support/haplo-plugin@ directory. If it does not, you may need to move the installer added line from @~/.profile@ to  @~/.bash_profile@ or @~/.bash_login@

h2. Manual installation

h3. Check Java is installed

In the Terminal window, type @java -version@

You must have Java 8 or later. The version number shown will be prefixed with '1.', so Java 8's version will be shown as '1.8'.

If you get an error, or need to update to Java 8, download "Java":https://java.com and install it in the default folder. Repeat the @java -version@ command to check it installed correctly.

If you are using a Linux system, your package manager should be able to install Java 8 for you.


h3. Download JRuby

Download the current release of "JRuby":http://jruby.org/download, which must be version 9.0.5.0 or later. Choose the "binary .tar.gz" version.

Decompress the downloaded file, then rename the extracted folder to @jruby@ (without the version number):

<pre>
    tar zxf ruby-bin-9.0.5.0.tar.gz
    mv jruby-9.0.5.0 jruby
</pre>


h3. Install the Plugin Tool

The Plugin Tool is distributed as a Ruby Gem.

Return to the Terminal window you opened. Type

<pre>
    export PATH=`pwd`/jruby/bin:$PATH
    jgem install haplo
</pre>

(This assumes you're running these commands with the current working directory set to the directory containing @jruby@.)


h3. Create a project folder

Create a folder inside your working folder, for example, @/Users/developer/haplo-development/example-project@, and @cd@ to it. In the @cmd@ window, type

<pre>
    mkdir example-project
    cd example-project
</pre>


h3. Check the installation works

Type @haplo-plugin --help@ to check the plugin tool is installed correctly.

h3. Persist PATH across sessions

If you installed JRuby manually, then you will either need to set your PATH every time you open a new Terminal window or alternatively configure your system to automatically append the @jruby/bin@ directory to the PATH.

To do so, add:

<pre>
    export PATH=/Users/developer/haplo-development/jruby/bin:$PATH
</pre>

to your shell configuration file.
