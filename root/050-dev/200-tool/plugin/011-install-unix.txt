title: Installation (UNIX or Mac)
--

The plugin tool requires a little bit of setup. These instructions work on Mac OS X and UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux.


h3. Create a working folder

Create a folder anywhere on your hard disc. We'll be using the example of @/Users/developer/haplo-development@ for simplicity. This working folder should be the root of your source control repository.

Open a Terminal window, and @cd@ to that directory.


h3. Check Java is installed.

In the command prompt, type @java -version@

If you get an error, install Java using your package manager. Mac OS X will either have Java installed, or this command will open a window offering to install it for you.


h3. Download JRuby

Download the current release of "JRuby":http://jruby.org/download. Choose the "binary tar.gz" version.

Decompress the downloaded file, then rename the extracted folder to @jruby@ (without the version number).


h3. Install the Plugin Tool

The Plugin Tool is distributed as a Ruby Gem.

Return to the Terminal window you opened. Type

<pre>
    export PATH=`pwd`/jruby/bin:$PATH
    jgem install haplo
</pre>

(This assumes you're running these commands with the current working directory set to the directory containing @jruby@.)


h3. Create a project folder

Create a folder inside your working folder, for example, @/Users/developer/haplo-development/example-project@, and @cd@ to it. In the @cmd@ window, type

<pre>
    mkdir example-project
    cd example-project
</pre>


h3. Check the installation works

Type @haplo-plugin --help@ to check the plugin tool is installed correctly.
