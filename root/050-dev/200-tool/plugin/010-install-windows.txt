title: Installation (Windows)
--

The plugin tool requires a little bit of setup.


h3. Create a working folder

Create a folder anywhere on your hard disc. We'll be using the example of @C:\haplo-development@ for simplicity. This working folder should be the root of your source control repository.

Open a @cmd@ prompt, and @cd@ to that directory.


h3. Check Java is installed.

In the command prompt, type @java -version@

If you get an error, download "Java":http://java.com/ and install it in the default folder. Repeat the @java -version@ command to check it installed correctly.


h3. Download JRuby

Download the current release of "JRuby":http://jruby.org/download. Choose the "binary zip" version.

Open the downloaded zip file, and drag the @jruby-x.x.x@ to the folder you created in the first step.

When that's finished, rename the extracted folder to @jruby@ (without the version number).


h3. Install the Plugin Tool

The Plugin Tool is distributed as a Ruby Gem.

Return to the @cmd@ window you opened. Type

<pre>
    set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jre6
    set PATH=C:\haplo-development\jruby\bin;%PATH%
    jgem install haplo
</pre>

(Change the folder in the second line to whatever folder you created in the first step.)


h3. Create a project folder

Create a folder inside your working folder, for example, @C:\haplo-development\example-project@, and @cd@ to it. In the @cmd@ window, type

<pre>
    mkdir example-project
    cd example-project
</pre>


h3. Check the installation works

Type @haplo-plugin --help@ to check the plugin tool is installed correctly.
