title: Installation (Windows)
--

The plugin tool requires a little bit of setup.


h3. Create a working folder

Create a folder anywhere on your hard disc. We'll be using the example of @C:\haplo-development@ for simplicity. This working folder should be the root of your source control repository.

Open a @cmd@ prompt, and @cd@ to that directory.


h3. Check Java is installed.

In the command prompt, type @java -version@

You must have Java 8 or later. The version number shown will be prefixed with '1.', so Java 8's version will be shown as '1.8'.

If you get an error, or need to update to Java 8, download "Java":https://java.com and install it in the default folder. Repeat the @java -version@ command to check it installed correctly.


h3. Download JRuby

Download the current release of "JRuby":http://jruby.org/download, which must be version 9.0.5.0 or later. Choose "Windows Executable" to download the JRuby installer.

Once downloaded, install JRuby by running the installer. The installer will append JRuby to your PATH enviornment variable.



h3. Install the Plugin Tool

The Plugin Tool is distributed as a Ruby Gem.

Open a new @cmd@ prompt (_An already open @cmd@ prompt will not reflect the changes to the PATH made by the JRuby installer_) and type:

<pre>
    jgem install haplo
</pre>



h3. Check the installation works

Type @haplo-plugin --help@ to check the plugin tool is installed correctly.



h3. Create a project folder

Create a folder inside your working folder, for example, @C:\haplo-development\example-project@, and @cd@ to it. In the @cmd@ window, type

<pre>
    mkdir example-project
    cd example-project
</pre>
