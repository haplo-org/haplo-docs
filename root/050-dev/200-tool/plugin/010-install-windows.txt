title: Installation (Windows)
--

To install the plugin tool, first install Java and JRuby, and then use the command line to install the @haplo-plugin@ utility.


h3. Check Java is installed.

In the command prompt, type @java -version@

You must have Java 8 or later. The version number shown will be prefixed with '1.', so Java 8's version will be shown as '1.8'.

If you get an error, or need to update to Java 8, download "Java":https://java.com and install it in the default folder. Repeat the @java -version@ command to check it installed correctly.


h3. Download JRuby

Download the current release of "JRuby":http://jruby.org/download, which must be version 9.0.5.0 or later. Choose a "Windows Executable" option to download the JRuby installer. (Only use the x64 version if you know you need it.)

Once downloaded, install JRuby by running the installer. The installer will append JRuby to your PATH enviornment variable.



h3. Install the Plugin Tool

The Plugin Tool is distributed as a Ruby Gem.

Open a new @cmd@ prompt (_An already open @cmd@ prompt will not reflect the changes to the PATH made by the JRuby installer_) and type:

<pre>
    jgem install haplo
</pre>



h3. Check the installation works

Type @haplo-plugin --help@ to check the plugin tool is installed correctly.
