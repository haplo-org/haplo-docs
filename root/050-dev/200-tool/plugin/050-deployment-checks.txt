title: Deployment checks
--

Before you request that your plugin should be reviewed and copied to the live servers, you should perform a couple of quick checks.

See [node:dev/process] for details of how plugins are deployed.


h2. Check all files

Run the @check@ command to syntax check all files.

<pre>
    haplo-plugin check
</pre>

Make sure the output of the command is @PASSED@.

Plugins which pass with @PASSED WITH WARNINGS@ may be acceptable, as any errors will be in the client side JavaScript files. While preferable that all JavaScript files pass the JSHint tests, it's not worth fixing JavaScript written by someone else.


h2. Test minimised version

When deployed, plugins are minimised to reduce the amount of data which is transferred to the browser. In normal development, the files you write are used directly. Before you deploy a plugin, you should check the minimised versions also work correctly.

Use the @--minimise@ option to upload a minimised version of the plugin.

<pre>
    haplo-plugin --minimise
</pre>

Upload will be a bit slower as the files need processing. When it's complete, test the client side parts of your plugin.
