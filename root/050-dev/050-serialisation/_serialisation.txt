title: JSON serialisation format
long_title: Haplo JSON serialisation format
--

[node:dev/store:Objects] and information associated with them, such as workflows and forms, are serialised into a standard JSON format that is used for APIs and data interchange.

Because Haplo is an extensible system, the serialiser uses [node:dev/serialisation/source:Sources] to include additional information along with the object metadata and attributes. When serialising an object, you need to specify which sources you want to include.

This format is used by functions including the [node:rest-api/objects:Objects REST API].


h2. Properties

The serialised form contains several categories of properties.

* [node:dev/serialisation/format]
* [node:dev/serialisation/metadata]
* [node:dev/serialisation/attribute]

In addition, [node:dev/serialisation/source:sources] may add additional information to the serialised object.


h2. Example

This example shows a simple serialised object with four attributes. It uses a single _source_ to include the username of authors in the attribute value.

Typical usage will include more [node:dev/serialisation/source:sources] and contain more information.
