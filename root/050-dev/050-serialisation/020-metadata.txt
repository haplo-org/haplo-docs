title: Object metadata
long_title: Serialised object metadata
--

Object metadata is used by the object store to manage the objects. This metadata is not part of the information the user is managing within the application.

All dates are in ISO8601 format.


h3(property). ref

The object's @ref@, as a string.


h3(property). url

The URL of the object, in the application's internal interface.

If used, the [node:standard/web-publisher] may make the object available publicly on a different URL.


h3(property). recordVersion

The version of this object. @1@ is the first version, and it is incremented every time the object is updated in the store.

The attributes of the object will not change without changing the @recordVersion@, but information from other sources will have their own independent versioning.


h3(property). labels

The @labels@ applied to this object, as an array of JSON objects with @ref@ and @title@ properties.


h3(property). deleted

A boolean value specifying whether this object is deleted.


h3(property). creationDate

The date and time this object was created in the object store.


h3(property). lastModificationDate

The date and time this object was last updated in the object store.
