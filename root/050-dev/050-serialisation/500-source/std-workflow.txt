The @std:workflow@ source adds information about workflows associated with the object, which are implemented using the standard [node:standard/workflow] plugin.

It depends on the [node:dev/serialisation/source/std-workunit] source, which must also be included, and adds additional information to each of the work unit records in the @workflows@ top level array.

You might want to include the [node:dev/serialisation/source/std-workflow-documents] source to obtain the forms associated with the workflow.


h2. Additional properties

The following properties are added to work unit records.

h3(property). state

The current state of the workflow.

h3(property). target

The current target of the workflow. This probably won't be specified for most workflows.

h3(property). url

The URL of the workflow, which may be the same as the URL of the object.


h2. Example

A serialised object with a single workflow.
