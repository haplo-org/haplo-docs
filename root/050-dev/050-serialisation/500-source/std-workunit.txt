The @std:workunit@ source adds information about work units associated with the object.

A top level @workflows@ property is added to the object, containing an array of dictionaries, each representing a single [node:plugin/interface/work-unit]. (The property is @workflows@ because it is most often used with the [node:dev/serialisation/source/std-workflow] source.)
