--

The @std:workflow:documents@ source adds the data stored in forms within the workflows associated with the object, which are implemented using the standard [node:standard/document-store/workflow:Document store plugin's workflow integration].

It depends on the [node:dev/serialisation/source/std-workflow] source, which must also be included, and adds additional information to each of the work unit records in the @workflows@ top level array.

h2. Additional properties

The following properties are added to work unit records.

h3(property). documents

A dictionary of document store name to latest version of the document.

The fields in the document are defined by the [node:plugin/form/specification:form specifications] which make up the document store.


h2. Example

A serialised object with a single workflow which contains two document store forms.
