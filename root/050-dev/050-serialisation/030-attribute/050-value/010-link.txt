title: link
link_as: keyword
--

The @link@ data type represents a link to another object. This is the primary data type for Haplo objects, as every thing and concept is represented as an object.


h2. Common properties

All values will have these properties.

h3(property). type

@"link"@

h3(property). ref

The string representation of the Ref of the linked object.


h3(property). title

The human readable @title@ of the linked object. This is a string which is suitable for presenting to users as a hyperlink to this object.


h2. Optional properties

The inclusion of other properties depends on the linked object. 

h3(property). behaviour

The [node:plugin/o/behaviour:Behaviour] of the linked object, if it has one.

Where the object represents a concept or a structural element, such as project types or organisational units, the behaviour is easier to use to identify the object than the @ref@.


h3(property). code

If the linked object is in the @dc:attribute:type@ attribute and is a type schema object, this property contains the API code of the type.

This may be more conveniently available in the [node:dev/serialisation/attribute#type:type] top level property.


h2. Sources

[node:dev/serialisation/source] may provide additional properties if included. This section lists commonly used sources, but is not an exhaustive list. Refer to the [node:dev/serialisation/source:sources] documentation for the full list.

h3(property). username

If the [node:dev/serialisation/source/std-username] source is included, and a [node:plugin/interface/security-principal:user] is represented by the linked object, the @username@ property will contain the username of the user, obtained from the user's @username@ tag.
