Information about the format and serialisation options are included for decoders.


h3(property). kind

The @kind@ property specifies the overall format of the serialised object. The value for the current version of the serialisation format is @"haplo:object:0"@.


h3(property). sources

Optional [node:dev/serialisation/source:Sources] may be used to include additional information in the serialised format. The @sources@ property is an array of source names used to generate the serialised object.

When using a serialised object, always test that the @sources@ contain the expected names.
