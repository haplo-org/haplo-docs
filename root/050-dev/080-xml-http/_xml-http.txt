title: XML-over-HTTP API
--

This document describes how to use the API to access and modify data in the Haplo [node:dev/store:object store] over the public Internet.

Objects are represented as XML documents. As they're loosely typed with many repeated elements, XML is a natural way of cleanly representing the information in the object store.

An API key is used to authenticate as a user of the system, and gives the external system the same permissions as that user. Multiple API keys can be generated for a single Haplo application to provide external systems with differing levels of access.

If this API doesn't work well for your application, you could consider writing a [node:dev/plugin:plugin] which implements a custom API. If you take this approach, you can still use the API key system for authentication.
