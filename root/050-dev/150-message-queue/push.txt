title: Push to endpoint
long_title: Message queue push to remote HTTPS endpoint
--

If your application pushes messages to an HTTPS endpoint on your systems, the configuration is specific to your application. We'll provide details on how to configure the HTTPS endpoint.

Options include:

* Sending messages immediately they're generated
* Sending batches of messages on a schedule
* HTTP Basic authentication
* SSL client certificates

Note that only @https:@ endpoints are supported. Haplo does not support unencrypted protocols.


h2. Reliability

When the remote endpoint returns a @200@ response, the messages will be marked as sent.

Any other status code or transport error will not mark them as sent, and the messages will be resent at some point in the future.


h2. Admin user interface

The admin user interface will include a button to send all messages to your endpoint, rather than waiting for a schedule. This is useful when you have marked a message for resending.
