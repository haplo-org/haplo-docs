title: Default format
long_title: Default message format
--

The default format for messages is a JSON document containing zero or more messages, along with a token which can be used to mark messages as read.

The top level properties are:

|@version@|Format version, currently @0@|
|@token@|An opaque token representing the messages included in this response.|
|@messages@|An array of zero or more messages.|

Within the @messages@ array, each entry will include the properties:

|@id@|The message ID.|
|@datetime@|The date and time in ISO8601 format when the message was generated.|

The messages will include other properties, but these will all be specific to your application and the integration.

Message IDs may not be sequential, and you can't use them to check that all messages have been received.

  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 10,
      "datetime": "2019-02-15T10:32:01Z",
      "type": "change",
      "project": "81q48",

    {
      "id": 43,

      "type": "notify",
      "project": "81y49",
