title: Permissions
--

Each user's permissions are defined by *permission label sets*. For each operation, a user has a "allow" set of labels, and a "deny" set of labels.

A set of labels applied to an object is said to *match* the permission label sets if at least one of the labels is in the *allow* set, and there are no labels in the *deny* set.

You can see the calculated permission labels sets in System Management.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Users/Groups

After choosing a user or group, click 'Show calculated permission label sets...'.


h2. Operations

h3. Read

A user may read an object if the object's labels match the user's _Read_ permission label sets.


h3. Create

A user may create an object if the labels which will be applied match the user's _Create_ permission label sets.


h3. Edit

A user may edit an object if the object's labels match the user's _Edit_ permission label sets.

This permission does not permit changing the labels on an object, even though the user interface for relabelling an object is part of the object editor.


h3. Relabel

A user may change the labels applied to an object if the object's labels match the user's _Relabel_ permission label sets, *and* the new set of labels matches the user's _Create_ permission label sets.

The additional rule that the new set of labels must be allowed by _Create_ means that it is not possible for a user to create an object, then change the labels to something they wouldn't be allowed to create directly.


h3. Delete

A user may delete an object if the object's labels match the user's _Delete_ permission label sets.

Deletion applies the DELETED system label, which is then used by the Platform to hide the object from searches.


h3. Approve

A user may approve something relating to an object if the object's labels match the user's _Approve_ permission label sets.
