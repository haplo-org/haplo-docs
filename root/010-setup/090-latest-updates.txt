title: Latest updates
--

Latest updates are automatic email bulletins sent by Haplo to users showing recent items of interest added to the system. 

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Groups

Go to the relevant group and choose to edit the Latest updates settings.

 * Send emails: choose the frequency with which Latest updates emails are sent (or choose to never send emails)
 * Email format: choose plain or formatted
 * Email template: choose the email template for your latest updates emails

Choosing to use the setting from the parent group uses the parent group's email template setting by default, where this group is a member of another group.

Templates can be created or amended within [node:setup/appearance:email templates]. You can apply different templates to different groups; for example, your staff could receive an internal newsletter, but your clients receive a branded news service.

 * Remove settings: reset to default sets this user or group to use the defaults set on the parent group.

h2. Recommendations

Latest updates settings should be made on a per group basis wherever possible, though settings can be made on an individual basis. Settings on an individual user's account override those made on a group basis.
