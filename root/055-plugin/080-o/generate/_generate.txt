Generators are used to build formatted data for sending to the user in response to requests. They encapsulate creation, formatting, and delivering a file to the user.

All generator objects implement the [node:plugin/interface/binary-data] interface so they can be returned as responses to HTTP requests, or added to the file store.


h2. Example

An example response handler which generates a very simple spreadsheet.

<pre>language=javascript
P.respond("GET", "/do/example/xls", [
], function(E) {
    var xls = O.generate.table.xls("Test");
    xls.newSheet("Sheet1");
    xls.cell("Test").cell(2);
    E.response.body = xls;
});
</pre>
