--

This API provides access to cryptographically secure random numbers and data. Use these instead of JavaScript's @Math.random()@.


h3(function). O.security.random.int32()

Returns a 32 bit random integer.


h3(function). O.security.random.hex(length)

Returns @length@ hex-encoded bytes of random data.

If @length@ is not specified, this function will return an amount of data suitable for use as a secret key.


h3(function). O.security.random.base64(length)

Returns @length@ Base64-encoded bytes of data.


h3(function). O.security.random.identifier(length)

Returns @length@ bytes of random data, encoded using a modified Base64 encoding suitable for use in URLs.

If @length@ is not specified, this function will return an amount of data suitable for use as a secret key in a URL. If you are using this function for this application, you are recommended not to pass in a length and use the default. The default may change over time to meet revised security guidelines.

For compatibility with email clients and other applications which perform non-optimal URL auto-linking, the identifiers will never start or end with a character that is not alphanumeric. This very slightly reduces the amount of entropy in generated API keys.
