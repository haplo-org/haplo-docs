title: HTTP Client
--

The Haplo HTTP client allows plugins to access external services via HTTP or HTTPS, such as APIs for third-party systems.

h2. Interface

h3(function). O.httpClient(url)

This function creates a new [node:plugin/interface/http-client] object. The HTTP request is not performed at this point; further configuration may be performed before [node:plugin/interface/http-client#request] is called.

h2. Example

<pre>language=javascript
P.myHTTPCallback = P.callback("myHTTPCallback", function(data, client, result) {
    if(result.successful) {
        // use result.body
    } else {
        P.data[data.target] = "Failure: " + result.errorMessage;
    }
});

...
    let client = O.httpClient("http://www.example.com/api").
        method("PUT").
        body("application/json", "{ver: '1.0', operation: 'help'}");

    client.request(P.myHTTPCallback, {target: 'help-response'});
...
</pre>

Note: be aware of the limitations of the plugin's [node:plugin/interface/data-store], consider using a [node:plugin/interface/database] to avoid race conditions when reading and writing in background tasks.
