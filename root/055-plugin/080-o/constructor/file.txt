title: O.file()
link_as: keyword
--

Constructs a object implementing the [node:plugin/interface/file] interface.

If it is necessary to add the file to the file store, it will be added and committed before the @O.file()@ function returns. If the same file is added twice, only one copy will be stored, and it will retain the original filename.

If the requested file cannot be retrieved or added to the file store, an exception will be thrown.


h3(function). O.file(file)

If a [node:plugin/interface/file] is passed as an argument, the exact same object will be returned.


h3(function). O.file(fileIdentifier)

If a [node:plugin/interface/file-identifier] is passed as an argument, the @File@ it references will be returned from the file store.


h3(function). O.file(binaryData)

A [node:plugin/interface/binary-data] object, such as an uploaded or [node:plugin/o/generate:generated] file, will be added to the file store, then a @File@ object returned after committing the file to the file store.

You may need to set the @filename@ property of the @BinaryData@ object to give it a sensible filename.


h3(function). O.file(digest, fileSize)

Look up a @File@ by @digest@ and optional @fileSize@.


h3(function). O.file(object)

Look up a @File@ by properties on the @object@ passed as an argument. @object.digest@ must be a string, and the optional @object.fileSize@ must be a number.


h3(function). O.file(signedUrl)

Pass in a signed URL to efficiently copy files between applications that are co-located on the same hosting cluster. If this is not possible for any reason, an exception will be thrown.

Generate the signed URL on the application that contains the file to be copied with code like:

<pre>language=javascript
var signedURL = file.url({
  asFullURL: true,
  authenticationSignatureValidForSeconds: 600
});
</pre>

Then transfer this URL to the application to which the file should be copied (perhaps using a message bus), and then pass it to @O.file()@ to copy the file.

The @pCopyFilesBetweenApplications@ privilege is required to copy files between applications.
