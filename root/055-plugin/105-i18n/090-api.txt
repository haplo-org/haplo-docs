--

The platform provides APIs to build internationalised applications.

The main API is through the [node:plugin/interface/locale] interface, obtained from a plugin, and the automatic translation of [node:plugin/i18n/form:forms] and [node:plugin/i18n/workflow:workflows].

In addition, the platform provides some [node:plugin/o/locale:low level] and [node:plugin/interface/security-principal#Interface_internationalisation:user] APIs for use by special purpose plugins.
