title: User's locale
--

Each user has a configured locale. This can be set for the user, or inherited from a Group.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Users > (user name) > Localisation

Click the 'Edit' button and choose the locale.

To set the locale for a group,

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Groups > (group name) > Localisation

This can be useful for setting the default locale for groups of users. For example, the "Madrid Office" group may find the Spanish locale a useful default.

The user setting overrides any locale set on their group.

Set the locale of the @Everyone@ group to set the default locale of this application.
