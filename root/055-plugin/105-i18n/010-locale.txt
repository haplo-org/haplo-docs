title: Locales
--

A *locale* represents a language translation, regional features, and other technical requirements to meet the local requirements of a group of users.

An individual [node:plugin/i18n/user-locale:user's locale] is configured through the management user interface or through APIs.


h2. Locale interface

The [node:plugin/interface/locale] interface is the main platform API for internationalisation features.

Because Haplo applications are built from many plugins, some of which are generic and used in many applications, much of the internationalisation information is specific to a plugin, and resources are packaged within the individual plugins.

@Locale@ objects are obtained from a [node:plugin/interface/plugin/i18n#locale:Plugin], and provide access to platform-wide and plugin specific internationalisation resources.
