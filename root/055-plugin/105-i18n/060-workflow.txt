Text in [node:standard/workflow:Workflows] is translated using strings from the @workflow@ category.


h2. Translating workflows

Text provided by the [node:standard/workflow/definition/text:workflow text system] is translated before any other interpolations (eg [node:plugin/misc/name]).

Extract strings from workflows by temporarily installing the @design_i18n_utility_extract_translatable@ plugin.

After translation, include the translated @<localeId>.workflow.json@ files in your plugin.


h2. Using translated workflows

You do not need to write additional code to translate workflows. The user's current locale is used to automatically select the translation when displaying the workflow user interface.
