[node:plugin/form:Forms] are translated using strings from the @form@ category.


h2. Translating forms

User readable strings in the specification are translated before any other interpolations (eg [node:plugin/misc/name]).

Extract strings from forms by temporarily installing the @design_i18n_utility_extract_translatable@ plugin.

After translation, include the translated @<localeId>.form.json@ files in your plugin.


h2. Using translated forms

You do not need to write additional code to translate forms. The user's current locale is used to automatically select the translation when displaying forms.
