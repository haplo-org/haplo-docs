title: std:ui:choose
link_as: keyword
--

This template renders a simple list of option for the user to choose from. Each option is rendered as a large type link with optional smaller explanatory text below. Each choice has a large click target.

Use this when you want a user to choose from two or more options, and clicking through does not perform any actions. For choices where an action is taken, the [node:plugin/templates/std-template/ui-confirm] template may be more appropriate as the actions use @POST@ requests.

Obtain a [node:plugin/interface/template] object with @P.template("std:ui:choose")@, or use the @template:std:ui:choose()@ template function.
