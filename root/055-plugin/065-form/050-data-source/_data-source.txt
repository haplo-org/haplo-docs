Data sources are defined using the [node:plugin/interface/plugin/form#dataSource] function on your [node:plugin/interface/plugin].

The @name@ is used in the @dataSource@ property of form elements, such as [node:plugin/form/specification/lookup] form elements. The @kind@ defines what kind of source to create, and the @definition@ defines the exact nature of the source.

Each data source defines what IDs it will store in the _document_, and the display name for each ID.
