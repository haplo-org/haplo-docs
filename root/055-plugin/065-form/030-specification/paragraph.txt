title: Paragraph
--

A simple multiline text field, corresponding to an HTML @<textarea>@ element.


h2. Properties

|@type@|@"paragraph"@|
|@rows@|(optional) The number of rows in the @<textarea>@. A suitable default will be chosen if this is not specified.|
|@validationCount@|(optional) Description of min and max word/character counts, see below.|

All the [node:plugin/form/specification#Common_properties:common properties] are supported.


h3. validationCount

This property describes the required word or character count to pass validation. When present, a counter is shown in the UI.

For example, to ensure that a paragraph has at least 10 words, use a definition like:

<pre>language=json
{
  "type": "paragraph",
  "label": "At least ten",
  "required": true,
  "validationCount": {
    "min": 10
  }
}
</pre>

In this example, @required@ specifies that a blank paragraph is not permitted, and the @validationCount@ specifies is must have at least 10 words.

Within the @validationCount@ definition, all properties are optional. To just display a word counter without any validation, set it to @{}@.


h3(property). min

The minimum count for this paragraph element.

*IMPORTANT* If you specify @min@, you probably also want to set @required@ to @true@ in the main element definition to ensure that a blank paragraph is not accepted.


h3(property). max

The maximum count for this paragraph element.


h3(property). unit

The units of counting. The default is @"word"@ to count words. Set to @"character"@ to count characters.


h3(property). minFailureMessage

The validation message to display when the count is less than the minimum.


h3(property). maxFailureMessage

The validation message to display when the count is greated than the maximum.


h3(property). limitText

The text to display in the UI to describe the limits, next to the counter. This should be very short.
