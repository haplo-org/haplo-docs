title: Test runner
--

The test environment is set up by the @t.test()@ function, which calls the test function passed as the first argument.

You must surround your test with this boilerplate to integrate correctly into the testing environment:

<pre>language=javascript
t.test(function() {
    // Your test goes here
});
</pre>


h3(function). t.test(testFn)

Set up the test environment then run the test, reporting back success or failure via the [node:dev/tool/plugin].

@testFn@ is a function which is called with no arguments. The return value is ignored.
