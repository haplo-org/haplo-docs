This file transform step fills in fields in PDF and word processing documents. The @information@ property on the [node:plugin/interface/file-transform-result] is used to return information about which fields were filled.

*NOTE:* This transform is implemented by an optional platform component, and may not be available in your installation.


h2. Creating input documents

Text form fields are filled in when filling a PDF file.

@MERGEFIELD@ fields are filled in when filling a word processing document, and @IF@ fields are used to conditionally include content. A definition should look like @"MERGEFIELD FieldName"@ where @FieldName@ is the name which should be used in the @fields@ property.

h3. Using Microsoft Word

To use Word to insert @MERGEFIELD@ fields into a document without creating a mailmerge, you need to do some one-off setup.

 * In the title bar of any Word document, click down the arrow at the end of the left group of buttons (Customise Quick Access Toolbar)

 * Menu: _More commands..._

 * Choose commands from: _All commands_

 * Select: _Insert a Field..._

 * Click the @[ > ]@ button

 * Click _Save_

An _insert field_ button will appear in the title bar at the very top of the window:

This setup step only need to be performed once.

h3. MERGEFIELD

A @MERGEFIELD@ will be replaced by the value of the field in the @fields@ property:

 * Click the _insert field_ button in the window title

 * Categories: _Mail Merge_

 * Field names: _MergeField_

 * Fill in box so it says: @MERGEFIELD Something@, where _Something_ is the name of the field

 * Click _OK_

h3. IF

An @IF@ conditionally includes formatted text, based on the value of a field in the @fields@ property. It's a little bit more convoluted to set up.

 * Click the _insert field_ button in the window title

 * Categories: _Mail Merge_

 * Field names: _If_

 * Fill in the box so it says @IF X = "Value" "True" "False"@, where _Value_ is the value you want to test the field against.

 * Click _OK_

 * @False@ will appear in your document. Right click it, and choose _Toggle field codes_.

 * Delete the X from the @IF@ definition, and click the _insert field_ button again. This time, create a @MERGEFIELD@ with the name of the field you want to test (see instructions above).

 * Edit the definition so @True@ is the text you want inserted in the document when the value is equals, and @False@ is the text otherwise. Either of these can be the empty string, @""@, to insert nothing.

 * You can use formatting on the inserted text, such as bold and italic.

After you have completed entering the field, it will look something like:

You can include line breaks and multiple paragraphs in the conditionally included text, but not the @"@ character. Smart quotes can be used as a workaround.

Tip: Write long text outside the @IF@ field, format it, then cut and paste it into the field.


h2. Information in result

The @information@ property in the [node:plugin/interface/file-transform-result] will contain a @"std:generate:fill_fields"@ property. This is an array of objects, one per fill fields transform step.

Each of these objects contains an @"filled"@ property, an array of field names that were filled in, and an @"unfilled"@ property, of those where a value was not specified in the @fields@ property of the specification. If fields are repeated in the input file, these arrays will contain multiple entries for that field.

For example:

<pre>language=json
{
  "std:generate:fill_fields": [
    {
      "filled": ["Field 1", "Field Two", "Field 1"],
      "unfilled": ["Three"]
    }
  ]
}
</pre>


h2. Transform specification

h3(property). input

Name of the input file. Optional, defaults to @"input"@.


h3(property). output

Name of the output file. Optional, defaults to @"output"@.


h3(property). mimeType

MIME type of the output file. Optional, defaults to the MIME type of the @input@ file.

This transform step can convert between different formats of word processing documents, and word processing documents to PDF.


h3(property). fields

A dictionary of field name to field value, both of which must be strings.
