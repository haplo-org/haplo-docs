title: Aliased attribute queries
--

Plugins can query the schema to find out more information about the aliased attributes defined in the current application.


h2. Schema query

h3(function). SCHEMA.getAliasedAttributeInfo(aliasedAttribute)

Returns a JavaScript object with properties describing the aliased attribute, described below.

@aliasedAttribute@ must be one of the [node:plugin/schema/schema-global/aliased-attr] properties. You should not rely on the exact underlying type of this value in your code.


h2. Info properties

Each attribute information object contains the following keys:


h3(key). name

The name of the aliased attribute, suitable for displaying to the user.


h3(key). code

The API code for the attribute, eg @"std:aliased-attribute:name"@. May be @undefined@ if the aliased attribute does not have an API code.


h3(key). aliasOf

The underlying attribute this value is an alias for. Returns one of the [node:plugin/schema/schema-global/attr] properties.


h3(key). shortName

The short name, or "search name", of the aliased attribute. Used in search constraints.
