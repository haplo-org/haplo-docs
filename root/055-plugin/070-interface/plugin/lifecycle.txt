--

The Platform calls functions on your plugin object at various times in its lifecycle. Use this for performing setup and other actions.


h2. Interface (for overriding)

Define your own implementations of these functions by adding them to the @P@ object implementing your plugin.


h3(function). onInstall()

Called at least once when the plugin is installed or upgraded.

Since it may be called more than once, the plugin should check it needs to perform an action before taking that action.

This function is called with full permissions.


h3(function). onLoad()

Called just after all the plugin's JavaScript files have been loaded into the JavaScript runtime, when you can guarantee that all other plugins are loaded.

This function is called with full permissions.
