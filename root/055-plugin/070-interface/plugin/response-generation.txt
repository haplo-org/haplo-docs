long_title: Plugin response generation
--

The Platform provides many features to help you generate the response HTML for your request handler. Note that the use of templates is built into the [node:plugin/interface/exchange] object passed into your [node:plugin/request-handling:request handler], and you only need to use the @template()@ function if you're doing something special.


h2. Interface

h3(function). template(templateName)

Retrieve one of the plugin's template objects.

For request handling, it's often not necessary to use this directly, but it's useful for rendering things as HTML in other parts of the plugin.

It can also be used to retrieve a standard template, the names of which all begin @std:@.


h3(function). globalTemplateFunction(name, templateFunction)

Define a [node:plugin/templates/functions/plugin-functions:plugin defined template function] for use in this and all other plugins.

As the function is available to all plugins, the name must contain an @:@ character, and should be in an appropriate namespace.

The @templateFunction@ is called for each occurrence of the template function when a template is rendered, with the arguments from the template and @this@ set to a [node:plugin/interface/template-function-this] object.


h3(property). staticDirectoryUrl

The public facing path to the @static@ directory, used for referring to the static resources.

The path returned does *not* contain a trailing @/@.


h3(function). rewriteCSS(css)

Given a string containing some CSS, rewrite it to reflect the current application.

The replacements are the same as the [node:plugin/directory-structure/css-rewriting:CSS rewriting for static files].
