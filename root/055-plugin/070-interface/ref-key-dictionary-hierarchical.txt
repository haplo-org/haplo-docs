A JavaScript object implementing the @RefKeyDictionaryHierarchical@ interface is very similar to a [node:plugin/interface/ref-key-dictionary], except that @get()@ methods respect object hierarchy.

This is particularly useful for storing information about object types. If you request a value for an @Ref@ without an explicit value, the value for the nearest parent will be returned.

Hierarchy is defined using the standard _parent_ attribute, @std:attribute:parent@, which is used in the shortcut [node:plugin/interface/store-object#firstParent] function in the [node:plugin/interface/store-object] interface.


h2. Construction

Use [node:plugin/o/constructor/refdict-hierarchical]. Pass in an optional value constructor function and size hint.


h2. Interface

@RefKeyDictionaryHierarchical@ implements the interface of [node:plugin/interface/ref-key-dictionary], except:


h3(function). get(key)

@get()@ works identically to @RefKeyDictionary@ [node:plugin/interface/ref-key-dictionary#get], except that if the dictionary does not contain a value, the nearest parent is returned instead.


h3(function). getAllInHierarchy(key)

Returns an @Array@, which may be empty, returning all the values in the dictionary for the given object, and all it's parents.

The array is ordered from the top of the tree to the child node specified by @key@.
