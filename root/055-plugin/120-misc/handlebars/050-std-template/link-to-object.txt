title: std:link_to_object
link_as: keyword
--

This template renders an @<a>@ tag to link to a [node:plugin/interface/store-object], generating a link URL and the HTML escaped title of the object.

Consider using the [node:plugin/misc/handlebars/std-template/link-to-object-descriptive] template instead.

There is also a [node:plugin/misc/handlebars/std-helper/link-to-object] helper, which may be easier to use.
