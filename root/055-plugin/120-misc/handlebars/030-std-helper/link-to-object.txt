title: std:link_to_object
link_as: keyword
--

This helper renders an @<a>@ tag to link to a [node:plugin/interface/store-object], generating a link URL and the HTML escaped title of the object.

<pre>
    {{std:link_to_object object}}
</pre>

@object@ is the name of the property in the view which contains the object.

Consider using the [node:plugin/misc/handlebars/std-helper/link-to-object-descriptive] helper instead.
