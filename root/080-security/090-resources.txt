h2. Full disk encryption software

h3. Windows

Some versions of Windows have "BitLocker":https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732774(v=ws.11).aspx built in. If your version of Windows provides BitLocker, you should "enable it":https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/e7d75dd2-29c2-16ac-f03d-20cfdf54202f/turn-on-device-encryption, but if it doesn't, you can use products such as "PGP Whole Disk Encryption":https://www.symantec.com/business/whole-disk-encryption.

h3. Mac OS X

Mac OS X includes FileVault for hard disc encryption. It was significantly improved in the Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) release.

 * "FileVault 2":https://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790 in Mac OS X Lion transparently encrypts the entire hard disc.
 * "Legacy FileVault":https://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?path=Mac/10.6/en/8727.html in previous versions of Mac OS X encrypt users' home folders only. This protects confidential information on lost laptops, but doesn't prevent tampering with the operating system.

It's worth upgrading to the latest Mac OS X for FileVault 2.

h3. Linux

See your distribution's documentation for the options available to you, for example, "LUKS":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup.
