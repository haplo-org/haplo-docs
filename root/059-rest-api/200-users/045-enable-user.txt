API_ENDPOINT /api/v0-user/enable/[userid] (POST only)

When generating URLs, @[userid]@ is the id of a user [node:/plugin/interface/security-principal]

A parameter of @status@ with value of either @block@ or @active@ should be passed with requests to the endpoint. Passing @block@ will disable the user, set @isActive@ to false, and block the user from logging in. Blocking an already blocked user will do nothing. Passing a value of @active@ will re-enable a blocked user, allow them to log in again, and set @isActive@ to true. Setting an already active user as active will have no effect
