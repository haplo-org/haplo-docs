title: Get linked objects
--

Given the ref of an object, returns a list of all objects which link to this object. Results are paged, so multiple requests may need to be made to retrieve the entire list.

API_ENDPOINT /api/v0-object/linked/[ref] (GET)

When generating URLs, @[ref]@ is the ref of a [node:/plugin/interface/store-object:store object].

h2. Request

In addition to the ref of the store object, the URL may include some optional parameters.

|@attribute@|Restrict results to objects linked to this object in the given attribute, specified as the API code. For example, @std:attribute:project@.|
|@qualifier@|When @attribute@ is used, restrict further to objects linked with the given qualifier, for example @dc:qualifier:alternative@.|
|@type@|Restrict to objects of a given type, for example, @std:type:project@|
