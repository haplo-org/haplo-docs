REST APIs are provided to access and modify objects and data in Haplo applications. The APIs use JSON formatted requests and responses.

They are not enabled by default. You must install the plugins for the specific APIs that you need.

An [node:dev/api-key:API key] is used to authenticate as a user of the system, and gives the external system the same permissions as that user. Multiple API keys can be generated for a single Haplo application to provide external systems with differing levels of access.
