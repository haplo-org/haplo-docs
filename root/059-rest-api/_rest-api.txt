title: REST API

--

REST APIs are provided to access and modify objects and data in Haplo applications. The APIs use JSON formatted requests and responses.

They are not enabled by default. You must install the plugins for the specific APIs that you need.

An [node:dev/api-key:API key] is used to authenticate as a user of the system, and gives the external system the same permissions as that user. Multiple API keys can be generated for a single Haplo application to provide external systems with differing levels of access.


h2. Other APIs

These generic APIs provide low-level access to the underlying Haplo API, exposing the [node:plugin/interface:server-side interfaces] as reasonably convenient REST APIs.

It may be easier to use one of the alternative APIs:

* The [node:import/rest-api:Data Import REST API] to map and write data, as it provides additional features that may be more convenient to use.
* A [node:dev/message-queue:message queue], including the generic [node:dev/global-observation:global observer] to be notified of changes as they happen.
* [node:import/user-sync] for managing users and their associated information.
* The [node:standard/reporting/rest-api:Reporting REST API] to access summary information.
* A custom API built with the server-side [node:plugin].
