title: Desktop computers
--

While protecting desktop computers is one of the easier security tasks, they're still vulnerable to theft, unauthorised users and malware.


h2. User accounts

p(recommendation). You __must__ use individual accounts on your computer, and each account __must__ be accessed with a strong password.

Every modern operating system has the ability to use individual accounts, so that everyone can work in isolation. You __must not__ share user accounts. You __must__ use individual accounts for everyone.


h2. Practise good security hygiene

p(recommendation). You __must__ follow sensible security practises on any computer which is used to access confidential information.

In particular:

 * Run up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software.
 * Run the most secure web browser possible.
 ** For example, "Google Chrome":http://www.google.com/chrome and "Safari":http://www.apple.com/safari version 5.1 and later include "sandboxing":http://www.apple.com/safari/features.html#security to minimise the effects of flaws.
 ** *Do not* use Internet Explorer on Windows XP, as it lacks any modern protection whatsoever.
 * Ideally use one web browser for surfing the web, and the other for sensitive information.
 * Make sure all your software is kept up to date, wherever possible with automatic updates.
 * *Do not* download and install any software, screen savers, or "fun" plugins from the internet. Only install trusted software you need to do your job.


h2. Use encryption software

p(recommendation). You __should__ use full disc encryption software on your desktop computers.

If your information is in any way sensitive, you __should__ use full disc encryption. This means that a password is required to decrypt your information, and if your password is strong enough, it should be safe from even the most motivated adversary.

If you do not use full disc encryption, any temporary copies on your computer can be accessed by someone with a small amount of technical knowledge, or the ability to use Google and download software. The password on your account is *no protection whatsoever* to someone who has physical access to your computer.

See [node:security/resources] for some recommended encryption software.


h2. Information stored on your computer

Your information is stored on our servers, and we look after it, back it up, and ensure its availability and security.

However, for you to actually use it, you need to make a temporary copy on your computer. These copies include:

 * Web pages cached by your browser -- while Haplo sets options to minimise the length of time its web pages are cached by your browser, it may remain accessible for a little while.
 * Your working files -- when you're working on a file, a copy is available on your computer until you delete it.


h2. Fingerprint readers

p(recommendation). You __must never__ rely on a fingerprint reader to protect access to your information.

Fingerprint readers are trivially bypassed, and the low quality fingerprint readers on laptops are especially vulnerable.

If you must use a fingerprint reader, be aware of its limitations, and use a strong password as well.


h2. Further recommendations

 * Lock your computer when away from your desk.
 * Discs, USB sticks, CDs and DVDs must be virus checked before use.
 * If you suspect you have a computer virus, get technical support immediately, and must not use your computer until it has been resolved.
 * You __should__ use the latest version of your operating system. Security features in mainstream operating systems have been dramatically improved in the latest releases.

Additionally, in a high security environment:

 * Ensure your desk and office furniture is arranged so visitors and other staff cannot easily look at your screen.
 * After it is no longer required, IT equipment, particularly hard drives, should be wiped and disposed of by specialists.
