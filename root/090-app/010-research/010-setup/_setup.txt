long_title: Setting up a Haplo Research Manager application
--

Typically you will work with a service provider to configure, customise and deploy your Haplo Research Manager application, and then provide 1st line support for the application once it goes live.

The key steps to setting up a Haplo Research Manager application are:

* Install the required plugins

* Set up the [node:app/research/setup/institution-structure]

* Set up the [node:app/research/setup/user-sync] so that users do not have to be manually managed

* Pre-deployment configuration
