title: Institution structure
--

Every Research application needs the institution structure set up to reflect the way the organisation is structured.

The institution structure is hierarchical, and can be as deep or shallow as needed. The various branches of the structure do not need to be the same depth.

Internally Haplo Research Manager calls the levels the University, Faculty, Department and School, but these are always renamed to reflect the actual names in use at the institution. This can be done by installing your institution's plugins, or by renaming the Types in System Management.

A tool is provided to generate a [node:dev/plugin/schema/requirements-schema:requirements.schema] file which can apply the institutional structure to the application, ready for the [node:app/research/setup/user-sync:user sync] to set the research institute for your users.


h2. Organisation unit codes

Each organisational unit making up the institution structure is given a code, called the "[node:dev/plugin/o/behaviour:configured behaviour]". Suitable codes are generated by the tool, and look like @example:research-institute:science@. This is so that other parts of the application, particularly the [node:import/user-sync], can refer to them unambiguously.

These codes are only visible to Administrators. Normal users won't see them.


h2. Generating the institution structure

1) Prepare a text file describing the institution structure, with the levels denoted by the number of @*@ characters in the prefix. For example:

<pre>
Example University
* Example Faculty
* * Department of Example Studies
* * Another department
* Other Faculty
* * Excellent Department
</pre>

2) Open the institution structure tool:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data Import > Institution structure

3) Enter the application prefix. Ask your developers if you are unsure what to enter. It's usually a short but unique name which identifies your institution, all in lower case.

4) Copy and paste your file into the _Institutional structure_ box and click _Generate requirements_.

The requirements will be displayed in a box below the form.

If you are a developer, you could copy the generated requirements into your application root plugin's @requirements.schema@ file.

Otherwise, you can apply these requirements manually.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Tools > Apply requirements

Copy and paste the generated requirements, then click _Apply schema requirements_.
