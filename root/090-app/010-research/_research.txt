title: Research Framework
--

The Research Framework application is the open source core of "Haplo Research Manager":https://www.haplo.com/research-manager. This provides:

* Core schema for representing an organisation which performs research, such as a University, Research Institute, or R&D department in a company.

* Building blocks for Research applications, such as data types, integrations with external systems, and researcher profiles.

* User sync data model within the [node:import:data import framework].

The code is available through the "haplo-research-manager":https://github.com/haplo-org/haplo-research-manager source code repository, under the MPLv2 license.
