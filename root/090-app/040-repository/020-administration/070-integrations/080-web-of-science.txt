title: Web of Science API
--

Haplo repository supports integration with the Web of Science API, there's a minimal amount of set up and once the integration is configured, harvesting will take place nightly entering the outputs into the [node:app/repository/administration/integrations/data-harvesting:Harvest-Claim Framework].

h2. Configuration

The Haplo integration with Web of Science API is designed to be as simple as possible, setup takes 2 steps.

h3. 1. Register for Web of Science API

In order to use the integration you will need an institutional account with "Clarivate":https://developer.clarivate.com to get an API key.

h3. 2. Configure the repository

Navigate to Keychain in System Management as shown below:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Keychain > Add new credential

Select Generic/Secret and add a credential name and the API key from the Clarivate account. If the API needs to be modified at any later point, the credential can be found under Keychain.

The default credential name is set to "Web of Science API" but a custom name can also be used.

Navigate to the configuration data in system management as shown below:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Configuration data

To the configuration data add:

@"repo_web_of_science:api_end_point": "https://wos-api.clarivate.com/api/<wos_version>"@

@"repo_web_of_science:api_enabled": true@

If a custom credential name is listed in the Keychain, then it should also be set in the Configuration data:
@"repo_web_of_science:api_credential_name": <same_credential_name_listed_in_keychain>@

_Note: The current Web of Science integration implementation supports the "Lite" API, therefore the endpoint used is https://wos-api.clarivate.com/api/woslite. For this integration, in order for the harvest to function correctly and retrieve anything, ORCID authentication should also be configured, hence the application should depend on the ORCID plugin._
