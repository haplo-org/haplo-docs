title: Web of Science API
--

Haplo repository supports integration with the Web of Science API, there's a minimal amount of set up and once the integration is configured, harvesting will take place nightly entering the outputs into the [node:app/repository/administration/integrations/data-harvesting:Harvest-Claim Framework].

h2. Configuration

The Haplo integration with Web of Science API is designed to be as simple as possible, setup takes 2 steps.

h3. 1. Register for Web of Science API

In order to use the integration you will need an institutional account with "Clarivate":https://developer.clarivate.com to get an API key.

h3. 2. Configure the repository

Navigate to Keychain in System Management as shown below:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Keychain > Add new credential

Select Generic/Secret and add a credential name and the API key from the Clarivate account. If the API needs to be modified at any later point, the credential can be found under Keychain.

The default credential name is set to "Web of Science API" but a custom name can also be used.

Navigate to the configuration data in system management as shown below:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Configuration data

To the configuration data add:

@"repo_web_of_science:api_enabled": true@

@"repo_web_of_science:api_end_point": "https://wos-api.clarivate.com/api/<wos_version>"@

Example:
@"repo_web_of_science:api_end_point": "https://wos-api.clarivate.com/api/woslite"@


If the Name in the keychain entry was changed from "Web of Science API" to a different name, then this name should also be updated in the configuration data.

Example:
Keychain name has been changed to "WoS API", therefore the configuration data should have the latter set as an api_credential_name:
@"repo_web_of_science:api_credential_name": "WoS API"@


_Note: The current Web of Science integration implementation supports the "Lite" API. For this integration, in order for the harvest to function correctly and retrieve anything, ORCID authentication should also be configured, hence the application should depend on the ORCID plugin._
