Haplo repository supports integration with Jisc's Publication Router, there's a minimal amount of set up and once the repository is configured to received notifications all claiming runs through the [node:app/repository/administration/integrations/data-harvesting:Harvest claim framework].

h2. Configuration

The Haplo integration with Publications Router is designed to be as simple as possible, setup takes 3 steps.

h3. 1. Register for Publications Router

In order to use the integration you will need an institution account with "Jisc's Publications Router":https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/. Once the account is created you should set the types of notifications you want to receive to your repository from different sources, this can be done from your Publications Router account.

h3. 2. Configure the repository

Navigate to the configuration data in system management as shown below:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Configuration data

To the configuration data add:

@"hres_repo_jisc_pub_router:end_point": "https://pubrouter.jisc.ac.uk/api/v3/routed/<client_account_id>"@

Where @<client_account_id>@ is substituted for the client account id as shown in your Publications Router account.

h3. 3. Run the initial import

In order to know to start collecting notifications the integration requires an initial import. This is done by navigating to the following link @"/do/hres-repo-jisc-pub-router/import?since=YYYY-MM-DD"@ (where @YYYY-MM-DD@ is replaced with the date from which you want the initial import to start) and selecting import.

This will import all notifications from the provided date up to now and then the integration will automatically harvest on a daily basis. There is no requirement for when this import should be from, only that it must be the *current date or earlier*.

E.g. if you want an initial import starting from the 1st June 2020 you would navigate to: @"/do/hres-repo-jisc-pub-router/import?since=2020-06-01"@.

Once the initial import has been run the system will automatically collect notifications daily, depositing all items into the [node:app/repository/administration/integrations/data-harvesting:Harvest claim framework] for matching to existing items and claiming/disclaiming by the authors.
