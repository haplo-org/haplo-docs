Haplo has plugins to allow users to integrate their GitHub accounts. Setting up GitHub integration requires the creation of a GitHub OAuth application. The system administrator should set this up for the application as a whole, once logged into the GitHub account you wish to create the application from navigate to "here":https://github.com/settings/applications/new, for this to work the "Authorization callback URL" in the application will need to be set to the application homepage, e.g. @https://research.universityofexample.ac.uk@.

Navigate to:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Keychain > Add new credential

to create the credential with these core entries:

|Name|GitHub Service|
|Kind|OAuth Identity Provider|
|Instance kind|OAuth2|
|auth_url|https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize|
|domain|_The domain of your application_|
|token_url|https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token|

Adding on the specific @client_id@ and @client_secret@ as shown in the GitHub application dashboard. You will also need to set the @ssl_ciphers@ in line with your security policy.
