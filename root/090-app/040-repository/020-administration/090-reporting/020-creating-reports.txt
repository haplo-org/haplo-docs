title: Creating and extending reports
--

Additional reports, and extensions to the existing reports, can be added in code using the [node:standard/reporting:Haplo standard reporting] framework. Adding new reports typically takes a matter of minutes for a developer to set up.

This provides a set of [node:standard/reporting/dashboards#Services:services] to allow you to add additional columns to the view or export of a report in the system in a few lines of code. To add a new report follow the [node:standard/reporting/dashboards#Example:example], adding the response handler in your application's code.

When setting up or extending a report, you may want to review the facts that are already being collected within the application, as reusing one of these will save time and effort. You can check which facts are currently being collected within a system by going to:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Reporting administration

and reviewing the relevant collection there.
