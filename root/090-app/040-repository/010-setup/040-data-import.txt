title: Data import
--

If your institution has an existing legacy repository system, you will want to import that data into Haplo.


h2. Import from EPrints

If your legacy system is an EPrints repository, you will be able to use the @haplo_repo_eprints@ plugin to import your existing data.

1. Install the plugin to your system

2. Take an export of all your data from EPrints in EP3 XML format 
This is easiest to do by going to the "advanced search" page, and searching for all items in the year range 1800-2200 (ie. a date range that covers all the contents of your repository). Then choose "EP3 XML" as your export format for the search results.

2. Go to @/do/hres-repo-eprints/upload-xml@

This will import the data assuming a standard EPrints setup - if there have been customisations to your EPrints installation you will need some additional code to be written to cope with the customisations. This will be written as an addition to the existing import framework, allowing the revast majority of the data conversion to be re-used from the generic implementation.

There are additional import reports detailing any data quality issues affecting the import available at @/do/hres-repo-eprints/admin@ in your system.


h2. Importing from other repository systems

The best method for importing data from a legacy system is to develop a plugin that reads the legacy system's native data format and converts records from that into the Haplo schema. Haplo Services will be developing these in response to our clients' requirements for hosted systems, so additional import modules will become available.

The repository has functionality to import records from external sources in a number of common formats (eg. Datacite XML, Dublin Core XML, etc.), which may be suitable depending on your institutions' requirements.
