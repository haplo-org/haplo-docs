long_title: Configuration data for public interface
--

NOTE: This configuration data is only for applications using the "standard public interface":https://github.com/haplo-org/haplo-repository/tree/master/hres_repo_standard_publication. If you have written your own publication plugin the configuration is probably managed in code, and you should contact your developer for changes.

h3. repo_standard_publication:hostname

h4. Expected type: String

The hostname of the publication, used if an institution intends to host their public interface on a different host to their internal system. If this isn't set, the default option is to use: "application_host_name/repository".

h3. repo_standard_publication:internal_application_hostname

h4. Expected type: String

The hostname of the internal view of the application, if not using the default value for @repo_standard_publication:hostname@. This value must be set if not using that default (which will usually be the case).

h3. repo_standard_publication:name

h4. Expected type: String

The repository name to be displayed in the public interface. By default it is set to the application name.

h3. repo_standard_publication:admin_email

h4. Expected type: String

The admin email address for the repository, which will be used for general enquiries about items in the system.
