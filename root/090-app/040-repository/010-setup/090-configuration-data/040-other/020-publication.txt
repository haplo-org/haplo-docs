long_title: Other configuration data for publications
--

NOTE: This configuration data is only for applications using the "standard public interface":https://github.com/haplo-org/haplo-repository/tree/master/hres_repo_standard_publication. If you have written your own publication plugin the configuration is probably managed in code, and you should contact your developer for changes.

h3. hres:repository:publication:prevent_keywords_inline_display

h4. Expected type: Boolean - Default: false

Alters the display of the keywords of an output, if set to true the keywords will display with a linebreak after each one.

h3. repo_publication_common:latest_additions:page:max_items

h4. Expected type: Integer - Default: 100

Sets the maximum number of outputs to show on the latest additions page.

h3. repo_publication_common:latest_additions:page_part:max_items

h4. Expected type: Integer - Default: 5

Sets the maximum number of outputs to show in the latest additions section of the home page.

h3. hres:repository:browse-by-year:first

h4. Expected type: Integer - Default: First output's date attribute

Sets the earliest year to display in the "Browse by year" section of the repository.

h3. repo_standard_publication:object:without_attributes

h4. Expected type: JSON object

Default keys: "output", "research-institute", "person", "event", "impact", "impact-evidence"

Each key in the object refers to the type of object that it restricts the attributes to.

|output|Any output|
|research-institute|Any research institute|
|person|Any person|
|event|Any event|
|impact|Any impact|
|impact-evidence|Any impact evidence|

List the API Codes of the attributes or aliased attributes in an array under any of these keys to prevent that attribute being displayed on the publication.

*Note: To restrict an aliased-attribute you can restrict either the base attribute OR the aliased attribute. Bear in mind that restricting the base attribute may have wider effects than you intend.*

E.g. To prevent creator citations showing

<pre>language=json
    "repo_standard_publication:object:without_attributes": {
        "output": [
            "hres:aliased-attribute:creators-citation"
        ]
    }
</pre>

or

<pre>language=json
    "repo_standard_publication:object:without_attributes": {
        "output": [
            "hres:attribute:authors-citation"
        ]
    }
</pre>

The first option here would prevent display of creator citations from practice based outputs, whereas the second option would prevent display of all citations whether they were creators on practice based outputs or authors on text based outputs.

h3. repo_standard_publication:object:only_attributes

h4. Expected type: JSON object

Default keys: "output", "research-institute", "person", "event", "impact", "impact-evidence"

Each key in the object refers to the type of object that it restricts the attributes to.

|output|Any output|
|research-institute|Any research institute|
|person|Any person|
|event|Any event|
|impact|Any impact|
|impact-evidence|Any impact evidence|

List the API Codes of the attributes or aliased attributes in an array under any of these keys to prevent that attribute being displayed.

*Note: To display an aliased attribute you will need to list the base attribute AS WELL AS the aliased attribute*.

e.g. To display the additional information on an output:

<pre>language=json
    "repo_standard_publication:object:only_attributes": {
        "output": [
            "std:attribute:notes",
            "hres:aliased-attribute:additional-information"
        ]
    }
</pre>

If only one of these attributes were listed no additional information attribute information would be displayed on the public interface.

h3. repo_standard_publication:carousel

h4. Expected type: Array of JSON objects

Sets the images for the carousel on the home page, by default the system randomly selects images from Pixabay. The object should be of the form:

<pre>language=json
{
  "image": "/~/a.jpg",
  "title": "University of Example",
  "imageDescription": "Banner image for the University of Example"
}
</pre>

Where:
# image: is the pathname of the image after it has been uploaded here:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Static files

# title is the text to display over the image
# imageDescription is the value for the alt attribute of the image


h3. repo_standard_publication:home_images

h4. Expected type: Array of strings

Sets the images displayed above the Browse/Search links on the home page in order. E.g. to change only the "Browse by Researcher" and "Browse by Subject" images: 

<pre>language=json
[
    "/~/a.jpg",
    "",
    "/~/b.jpg",
]
</pre>

Where the string value is the pathname of an image after it has been uploaded here:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Static files

h3. repo_standard_publication:use_short_item_urls

h4. Expected type: Boolean - Default: false

Some institutions want to use short URLs where the title of the output is not shown in the address bar.

h3. repo_standard_publication:research_institute_browse_images

h4. Expected type: Arrray of strings

Sets the images associated with each subject in the "Browse by Subject" by the order in which they are in the array, looping if the limit is reached.

<pre>language=json
[
    "/~/a.jpg",
    "/~/b.jpg",
]
</pre>

Would show images a.jpg and b.jpg alternating for the each research institute image.

Where the string value is the pathname of an image after it has been uploaded here:

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Static files

h3. repo_standard_publication:client_publication_features

h4. Expected type: Array of strings

Sets the use of client specific features, add the namespaced code of the feature to the array. Usually for use with client-specific object types that need to be rendered. Use **very** sparingly. Consider using a separate publication if this list gets long.
