title: Haplo Repository
--

Haplo Repository is a modern academic repository for the management and publication of research outputs and research data.

A single repository can manage all research outputs, including traditional scholarly publications, practise based research, and research data. Each output type can have different metadata, workflows and policies.

With integrated workflows and an intuitive user interface, Haplo offers high rates of engagement with your researchers and increases rates of self-deposit. Customisable workflows and reports allow all processes to happen inside the repository, including the UK REF process.

Building on the Haplo Platform, it has a flexible architecture that enables your repository to perfectly fit your institution and your research.

Highlights include:

* Public repository with a flexible toolkit for customised public interfaces to the repository
* Researcher web profiles
* Flexible ingest processes with clear, intuitive user experience, resulting in high levels of self-deposit from researchers
* Multiple per-file embargos on outputs
* Flexible schema, multiple types of outputs (including research data) to be managed in the same repository, standard protocol and metadata support, including OAI-PMH, DOI minting
* Support for managing restricted files including a “Request a copy” workflow to approve access to restricted files, and support for file preparation for research data (eg anonymisation).
* Out of the box ORCiD integration
* Support for practise based research
* Reporting, including UK REF compliance monitoring and reporting
* Impact and esteem recording
* High level of security, suitable for storing sensitive material with access restrictions
* Metadata import and compatibility with legacy repositories
