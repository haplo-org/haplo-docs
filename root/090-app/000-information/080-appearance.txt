title: Appearance
--

You can customise the appearance of Haplo, adding a header and changing the colours of the main user interface. This enables you to change the appearance of the application to match your organisation's branding.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Static files

Upload your logo file here, or any other image you wish to use in the setup of your system. Images will be available to anyone who knows the URL.

This is intended for files which are used in the visual appearance of the system, so there is a size limit.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Configuration > Appearance 

Use this palette to define the colours for Haplo and upload the logo and add the slogan displayed in the header.

h2. Email templates

Email templates enable you to customise the emails sent by Haplo. You need knowledge of HTML and CSS to edit these templates, and it's recommended you seek the assistance of a designer for the best results.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Email templates

Edit an email template: choose the email template from the list and click on Edit in the right hand panel.

Remove email template from menu: choose the email template from the list and click on Remove from menu in the right hand panel.

Removing a template from the menu stops it being selected in the future. The template will still be used if currently selected for any feature, removing it from the menu marks it as not intended for use.

Restore to menu: choose the email template from the list and click on Restore to menu in the right hand panel.

New email template: choose to create a new email template.
