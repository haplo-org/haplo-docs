title: Navigation
--

The navigation in the left hand column of each page provides easy access to key information, as grouped links to pages in the application.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Navigation

Different links can be displayed to different users, based on their Group membership.

In general, you should keep the number of links in the navigation relatively small.
