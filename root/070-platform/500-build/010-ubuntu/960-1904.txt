title: Ubuntu Server 19.04
long_title: Build on Ubuntu Server 19.04
--

Download "Ubuntu Server":https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server and install it on a system with *at least 4GB of memory* allocated. The instructions below are appropriate for Ubuntu 19.04. If you're not using 19.04, please refer to the "appropriate build instructions for your Ubuntu version":ubuntu.

If you just want to run a Haplo server with a minimum of fuss, go straight to the "running a production server":../run/production documentation.

*Important:* Do not include a dot in the hostname. A good hostname to choose would be @haplo@

If you're using a VM, you'll probably want to install openssh to allow you to log in from the VM host.

<pre>
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
</pre>


h2. Install required packages

After logging in, install packages with:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make openjdk-8-jdk maven avahi-daemon uuid-dev curl patch git libxapian30 libxapian-dev zlib1g
</pre>

Check the version of java with @java -version@. You must use Java 8, as older and newer versions aren't compatible. If it's not using Java 8, run @sudo update-alternatives --config java@ to set the correct version. Or, non-interactively:

<pre>
sudo /usr/sbin/update-java-alternatives -s java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64
</pre>

Install PostgreSQL 11 with:

<pre>
sudo apt-get install postgresql-11 postgresql-server-dev-11 postgresql-contrib-11
</pre>

[SNIPPET platform/build/postgresql-local-user]

Disable the PostgreSQL daemon and allow the current user to run the server with:

<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop
sudo update-rc.d postgresql disable
</pre>


h2. Setting up PostgreSQL

Create a database as the current user:

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/haplo-dev-support/pg
/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/initdb -E UTF8 -D ~/haplo-dev-support/pg
</pre>


h2. Running PostgreSQL for development and testing

Whenever you want to run the database, firstly, recreate the @/var/run/postgresql@ directory, as @/var/run@ gets wiped on every boot.

<pre>
sudo mkdir -p /var/run/postgresql
sudo chmod a+rwx /var/run/postgresql
</pre>

Then, leave the following command running in a terminal window:

<pre>
/usr/lib/postgresql/11/bin/postmaster -D ~/haplo-dev-support/pg
</pre>

Open another terminal window now, before moving on to building Haplo.

[SNIPPET platform/build/run-test-suite]

If more than one or two tests fail, your system doesn't have enough memory.


[SNIPPET platform/build/running-server]

<pre>
cd ~/haplo
db/init_app.sh haplo test.`hostname`.local "Test application" sme 4000
db/create_app_user.sh test.`hostname`.local "Ben Summers" ben@example.com password
echo Visit http://test.`hostname`.local:8080 in your browser.
</pre>

The Haplo server will use multicast DNS to broadcast the hostname for the application, so a web browser on the machine on which the VM is running should be able to connect to the server on the address printed by the @echo@ command.

You need to make sure your host OS can resolve multicast DNS:

*Mac OS X*: Supports multicast DNS out of the box.

*Linux*: Ensure the @avahi-daemon@ package is installed on the host OS.

*Windows*: There isn't a good multicast DNS implementation for Windows. Find the IP address of the VM by running @ipconfig -a@ in the VM, then add the application hostnames to the @C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts@ file on the Windows host.
