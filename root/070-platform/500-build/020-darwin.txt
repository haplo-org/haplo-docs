--

We recommend you use an [node:platform/build/ubuntu:Ubuntu VM] on your Mac, as macOS is a bit of a moving target. However, with a bit of work, it is possible to run Haplo on macOS directly.

You need a recent version of macOS with Xcode or the command line development tools installed. If you haven't got either installed yet, install the latter with

<pre>
xcode-select --install
</pre>

Then install Java 8 and "Maven":http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.

Check the version of java with @java -version@. You must use Java 8, as older and newer versions aren't compatible. If it's not using Java 8, use @/usr/libexec/java_home@ to set the appropriate @PATH@.

Use the current version of Maven, such as 3.5.4 or later.

h3. Install PostgreSQL

Download a recent version of PostgreSQL "Enterprise DB":http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#osx (we suggest version 10).

Install it with all the defaults, so it installs at @/Library/PostgreSQL/10@

h3. Setting up PostgreSQL

Create a database as the current user:

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/haplo-dev-support/pg
/Library/PostgreSQL/10/bin/initdb -E UTF8 -D ~/haplo-dev-support/pg
</pre>

*Important:* You need to make sure that the PostgreSQL @bin@ directory is in your path, for example, by adding the following to your @~/.profile@ file.

<pre>
export PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/10/bin:$PATH
</pre>


h3. Running PostgreSQL for development and testing

Whenever you want to run the database, leave the following command running in a terminal window:

<pre>
sudo launchctl stop com.edb.launchd.postgresql-10
/Library/PostgreSQL/10/bin/postmaster -D ~/haplo-dev-support/pg
</pre>

Open another terminal window so you can leave it running now.

[SNIPPET platform/build/run-test-suite]

You should expect a few tests to fail due to platform differences between our production environment and macOS. If lots of tests fail, you haven't got enough free memory.


[SNIPPET platform/build/running-server]

<pre>
cd ~/haplo
db/init_app.sh haplo test.`hostname` "Test application" sme 4000
db/create_app_user.sh test.`hostname` "Ben Summers" ben@example.com password
echo Visit http://test.`hostname`:8080 in your browser.
</pre>

The Haplo server will use multicast DNS to broadcast the hostname for the application, so a web browser on your Mac will be able to connect to the server on the address printed by the @echo@ command.
