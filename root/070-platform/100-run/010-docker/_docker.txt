If you have a system capable of running "Docker":https://www.docker.com/, you can run Haplo as a pre-built container. This might be on a Linux server with Docker installed, or on a Mac or PC using "Docker Desktop":https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop.

Because Haplo needs persistent storage to keep your data, it need to be run on a platform that supports persistent storage, which rules out Amazon ECS and Fargate.

We've put together more detailed instructions for running the Haplo Docker image on a number of platforms:

* [node:platform/run/docker/mac]
* [node:platform/run/docker/ubuntu]
* [node:platform/run/docker/fedora]
* [node:platform/run/docker/digitalocean]

h3. Building the Docker image

If you're interested in seeing how the Docker image is built, then you can look at the original source and Dockerfiles here: "https://github.com/haplo-org/haplo-docker":https://github.com/haplo-org/haplo-docker
