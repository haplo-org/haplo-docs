The Haplo Platform is a multi-tenant application server, with [node:app:applications] implemented through [node:plugin:plugins]. There is an administrative user interface for setting up applications, although more complex applications tend to be configured with code in a plugin.

How you run an instance of the Haplo Platform server depends on your intended use.


h2. Production server

You should run a [node:platform/run:production server] for your live applications, and also plugin development. Production servers can be put in "plugin debugging" mode, which adds support for the [node:dev/tool/plugin].


h2. Developing the platform

If you want to modify the platform itself, you can run a [node:platform/build:development build] which has a slightly different configuration, and includes platform development only functionality such as automatic reloading of platform code.
