The Haplo Platform offers the ability to build powerful applications for managing "real world" information that doesn't fit into a conventional database.

This is the technical documentation for Haplo, describing how to set up a Haplo application, [node:plugin:develop plugins] and [node:import:import data].

Documentation for [node:app:applications built on top of the platform] describes how to build customised applications on top of out-of-the-box functionality.

As you're probably dealing with confidential information in your Haplo application, you should read our [node:security].
