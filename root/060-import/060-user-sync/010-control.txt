title: Control file
long_title: User sync control file
--

To map the data from the external system to the Haplo data *Model*, you need to write a data import [node:import/control:Control file], which is slightly different to the control files used by other data import tasks.

* The model must be @haplo:user-sync@, as no other models are supported.

* The @files@ section should name all the files, and not use @DEFAULT@, as this list of files is used to determine whether all the files for the sync run have been received.

* Mappings from usernames to the @ref@ of People records is performed with special *Destinations* in the *Model*, because lookups need to be delayed until all user *Records* have been processed.

* There is no need to use the *remove-values* instruction, as relevant attributes from previous versions are automatically removed as the sync assumes that the mapped values represent the desired state.

The control file used in a sync run is stored along with the input files, and can be viewed in the [node:import/user-sync/admin-ui].


h2. Example

This minimal control file maps from a simple JSON format to the user sync Model. Real control files are likely to be a bit more complex.
