title: Control file
long_title: User sync control file
--

To map the data from the external system to the Haplo data *Model*, you need to write a data import [node:import/control:control file] for the @haplo:user-sync@ model.

The @files@ section is used to determine whether all the files for the sync run have been received, so it must name all the files without the use of @DEFAULT@.

Mappings from usernames to the @ref@ of People records are performed with special *Destinations* in the *Model*, because lookups need to be delayed until all user *Records* have been processed.

The control file used in a sync run is stored along with the input files, and can be viewed in the [node:import/user-sync/admin-ui].


h2. Example

This minimal control file maps from a simple JSON format to the user sync Model. Real control files are likely to be a bit more complex.
