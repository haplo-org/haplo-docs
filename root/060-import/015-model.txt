title: Model
--

When configuring a data import, start by reviewing the *Model*.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data import > Models

Choose the correct model for your data import. The user sync always uses the @haplo:user-sync@ model, but other data import processes and REST APIs can use any model provided by your application developers.

For each *Destination* in the Model, this page lists:

* The destination name for use in *Control* files
* Whether it's an optional destination that does not have to have any data
* A table describing all the *Names* in that Destination.

The columns in the Names table are:

|Name|The name which should be used in Control files to refer to this value.|
|Type|The data type of the value.|
|MV?|Whether this Name is multi-value.|
|Req?|Whether a value for this Name is required.|
|Description|A short description of the values expected.|

Some data types will have actions in the right column. _Map_ links to a page which generates example mappings for the Control file.
