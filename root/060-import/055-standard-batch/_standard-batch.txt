title: Standard batch import
--

Standard batch API imports provide [node:import/standard-batch/api:an API] and a user interface for performing regular imports of larger quantities of data into a Haplo application, along with a user interface for reviewing the data and logs of previous import jobs.


h2. API import

Using [node:import/standard-batch/api:the API for import] allows it to be scripted. This may be the most convenient method when you are preparing a data import using a test application, as your data preparation scripts can automatically upload and test the import each time you make a change.


h2. Manual import

When your data import is finalised, you can use the [node:import/standard-batch/user-interface:import user interface] for the import into your production application.


h2. Administrative user interface

All the batch import jobs are listed in the administrative user interface.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data import > Standard Batch APIs > Standard Batch API jobs

For each job, the data files and import log are available for download.

Where a job was run as a dry run for testing before a real import, you can copy the job and re-run it as a import.
