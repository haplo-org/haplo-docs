The @remove-values@ Instruction removes all the values from a *Name* in a *Destination*. *values* is plural because if the *Name* is a multi-value, then it will remove all the values set for that Name.

|@action@|@"remove-values"@|
|@destination@|The Destination to remove the values from.|
|@name@|The Name within the Destination to remove the values from.|


h2. Usage

@remove-values@ is most often used to remove all the values in a multi-value name before a [node:import/control/instruction/field] or [node:import/control/instruction/set-value] Instruction is used with the @multivalue:true@ option.

You probably won't need to use this Instruction unless you're explicitly handling multi-values in your control file.


h2. Example

<pre>language=json
{
    "action": "remove-values",
    "destination": "profile",
    "name": "std:attribute:job-title"
}
</pre>

See also the [node:import/control/instruction/field#Example_working_with_multi_values:working with multi-values] example for the @field@ Instruction.
