The @assert-destination@ Instruction checks whether a [node:import/model/depends:dependent destination] exists, or does not exist. This is used in batch imports to check whether the existing data is in the expected state.

If the expectation is not met, then an error is emitted, and this single *Record* is ignored. The import will continue with further Records in the input files.

|@action@|@"assert-destination"@|
|@destination@|The Destination to check.|
|@exists@|@true@ is the Destination should exist, or @false@ if it should not.|


h2. Example

To ensure that the @project@ Destination already exists before updating it, use:

<pre>language=json
{
    "action": "assert-destination",
    "destination": "project",
    "exists": true
}
</pre>
