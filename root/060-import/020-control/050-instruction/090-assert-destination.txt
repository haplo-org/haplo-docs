The @assert-destination@ Instruction checks whether a [node:import/model/depends:dependent destination] exists, or does not exist. This is used in batch imports to check whether the existing data is in the expected state.

If the expectation is not met, then an error is emitted, and the entire *Record* is ignored.

|@action@|@"assert-destination"@|
|@destination@|The Destination to check.|
|@exists@|@true@ is the Destination should exist, or @false@ if it should not.|


h2. Example

To ensure that the @project@ Destination already exists before updating it, use:

<pre>language=json
{
    "action": "assert-destination",
    "destination": "project",
    "exists": true
}
</pre>
