title: Instructions
class: DocNodeTextileWithTOC
--

*Instructions* tell the data import framework how to retrieve, map and convert values from the *Records* and set values in the *Model*.

Each Instruction in the @instructions@ array is defined by a dictionary, and executed in order for each Record.


h2. Independence of Instructions

Although Instructions are executed strictly in the order they appear in your control file, in general, Instructions are independent of each other.

Therefore they can appear in any order in your control file, with the following exceptions:

* Where an Instruction sets a value in a Destination, such as [node:import/control/instruction/field], and that Instruction has the @"multivalue":true@ option, if you use [node:import/control/instruction/remove-values] to clear the current values, that @remove-values@ Instruction must appear first in the control file.

* The [node:import/control/instruction/within] and [node:import/control/instruction/for-each] Instructions change the 'context' within the Record, execute their embedded @instructions@ list, then reset the context. To access the expected data, Instructions like [node:import/control/instruction/field] must appear within that embedded list of Instructions.


h2. Common properties

Some properties in the definition dictionary are common to all Instructions.

|@action@|The action of the Instruction. If not specified, defaults to @"field"@.|

Other properties will depend on the @action@ of the Instruction, and any [node:import/control/value-conversion:conversions] that need to be applied to the input data.
