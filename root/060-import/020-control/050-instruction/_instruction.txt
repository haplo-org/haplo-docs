*Instructions* tell the data import framework how to retrieve, map and convert values from the *Records* and set values in the *Model*.

Each instruction in the @instructions@ array is defined by a dictionary, and executed in order for each Record.


h2. Common properties

Some properties in the definition dictionary are common to all instructions.

|@action@|The action of the instruction. If not specified, defaults to @"field"@.|

Other properties will depend on the @action@ of the instruction, and any [node:import/control/value-conversion:conversions] that need to be applied to the input data.
