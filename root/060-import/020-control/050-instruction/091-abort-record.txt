The @abort-record@ Instruction stops processing of the current *Record* and outputs a message in the log. Use with the conditional Instructions to prevent data being imported if conditions are met. 

|@action@|@"abort-record"@|
|@message@|The message to output in the error log.|

See also [node:import/control/instruction/log-error], which can be used to output informational errors in the log without preventing the Record from being imported.

<pre>language=json

            "action": "abort-record",
            "message": "Researchers information not found"
