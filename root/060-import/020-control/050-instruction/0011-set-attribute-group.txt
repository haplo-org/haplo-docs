The @set-attribute-group@ Instruction copies all values from the source object to an [node:import/control/value-conversion/attribute-group:attribute group] in *Name* on a *Destination*.

|@action@|@"set-attribute-group"@|
|@source@|The name of the pseudo-destination for this attribute group.|
|@destination@|The Destination to store the value in.|
|@name@|The Name within the Destination to store the value in.|

Attribute groups are composed of multiple values which together describe a single concept, for example, a file and what level of access is required within the system to access it. These are assembled in a pseudo-destination using the @field@ and @set-value@ Instructions, then this Instruction combines the values together into an attribute group and appends that to the @destination@ object.

After this Instruction is executed, all the values in the pseudo-destination are cleared.
