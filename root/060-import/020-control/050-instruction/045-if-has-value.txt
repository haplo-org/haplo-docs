The @if-has-value@ instruction conditionally executes a nested lists of *Instructions* depending on whether a *Destination* has a value set. This is useful for setting default values.

|@action@|@"if-has-value"@|
|@destination@|The destination to check.|
|@name@|The Name within the destination.|
|@then@|An array of Instructions to be executed when the value exists in the Destination (optional).|
|@else@|An array of Instructions to be executed when the value does not exist in the Destination (optional).|

h2. Example

To ensure a object always has a title by applying a default if no other value has been set, add this to the *end* of your control file's instructions.

<pre>language=json
{
    "action": "if-has-value",
    "destination": "book",
    "name": "dc:attribute:title",
    "else": [
        {
            "action": "set-value",
            "destination": "book",
            "name": "dc:attribute:title",
            "value": "Unnamed project"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
