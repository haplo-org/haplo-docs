title: field-structured
--

The @field-structured@ instruction copies a [node:import/control/value-conversion/structured-value:structured value] to a *Name* in a *Destination*.

|@action@|@"field-structured"@|
|@structured@|The name of the pseudo-destination for this structure value type.|
|@destination@|The destination to store the value in.|
|@name@|The Name within the destination to store the value in.|

Structured values are composed of multiple values, for example, the various fields in an address or a person's name. These are assembled in an pseudo-destination using the @field@ and @add-value@ instructions, then this instruction converts it to the structured data type. See [node:import/control/value-conversion/structured-value] for full details.

After this instruction is executed, all the values in the pseudo-destination are cleared.
