The @load@ Instruction loads an existing piece of data represented by a *Destination*. If that data does not exist, other Instructions can be executed, enabling "load or create" style operations.

If the @otherwise@ Instructions aren't specified, and it isn't possible to load the data into the Destination, an error will be reported and nothing will be committed for this *Record*.

|@action@|@"load"@|
|@using@|The name of the [node:import/model/pseudo:pseudo-destination] for the required method of loading the object. The values in this Destination must have been set by previous Instructions.|
|@destination@|The Destination for this data.|
|@otherwise@|(optional) If specified, the Instructions to execute if the data does not already exist.|

It the @load@ Instruction should not be used for [node:import/model/depends:dependent destinations].


h2. Example

Try to load a person, and if it doesn't already exist, create one setting the person object's type to Staff:

<pre>language=json
{
    "source": "PERSON-USERNAME",
    "destination": "load:by-ref",
    "name": "ref",
    // filters or mapping from username to ref
},
{
    "action": "load",
    "destination": "profile",
    "using": "load:by-ref",
    "otherwise": [
        {
            "action": "new",
            "destination": "profile"
        },
        {
            "action": "set-value",
            "destination": "profile",
            "name": "dc:attribute:type",
            "value": "std:type:person:staff"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
