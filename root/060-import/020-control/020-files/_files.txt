title: Files
class: DocNodeTextileWithTOC

The @files@ property specifies how the files are to be interpreted, mapping from file names to file properties.

Files in a *Batch* are named, so that different files can be read in different ways. The @"DEFAULT"@ name is used if a file name is not individually specified.

h2. File properties

File properties always use the @"read"@ property to specify the format of the file. Built in formats are listed below, and plugins can extend the framework with additional formats.

h2. Example

<pre>language=json
"files": {
    "DEFAULT": {
        "read": "json"
    },
    "table" {
        "read": "tsv-with-name-row",
        "charset": "windows-1252"
    }
}
</pre>

In this example, the @table@ file is read as a TSV file in the Windows-1252 charset, and any other file will be read as JSON.
