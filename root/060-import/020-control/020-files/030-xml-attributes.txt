title: xml-attributes
--

The @xml-attributes@ format reads an XML file, where the root element contains child elements which form the *Records*. The attributes of these elements are the values in the Record.

The names of the elements are ignored.

The charset of the input file is read from the XML declaration. If no declaration is present, UTF-8 is assumed.

|@"singleRecord"@|If @true@, treat the input file as a single record (without a containing root element) instead of multiple records. This is useful for defining [node:import/rest-api:REST APIs].|
