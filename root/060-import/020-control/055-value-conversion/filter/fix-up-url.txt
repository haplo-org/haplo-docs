title: haplo:fix-up-url
link_as: keyword
--

The @haplo:fix-up-url@ value filter attempts to correct URLs without a scheme into valid URLs by prefixing them with @https://@, as long as the format looks like it'd be a valid URL otherwise.

This cannot fix URLs properly, but may be useful for some data sets.

h2. Example

<pre>language=json
{
    "source": "URL",
    "destination": "project",
    "name": "std:attribute:url",
    "filters": ["haplo:fix-up-url"]
}
</pre>
