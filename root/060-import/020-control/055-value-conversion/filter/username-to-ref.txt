The @haplo:username-to-ref@ value filter converts a username of a user managed by the [node:import/user-sync] to a Ref value which can be used to load profile objects, and add references to that person to other objects.


h2. Example

Your input data might include the username of people. To convert it into a Ref which can then be used by a [node:import/control/instruction/load] instruction, use:

<pre>language=json
{
    "source": "USERNAME",
    "destination": "load:by-ref",
    "name": "ref",
    "filters": ["haplo:username-to-ref"]
},
{
    "action": "load",
    "destination": "profile",
    "using": "load:by-ref"
}
</pre>
