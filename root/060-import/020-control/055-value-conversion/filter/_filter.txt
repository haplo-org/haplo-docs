Input data can be passed through multiple value filters to convert the values in the input *Record*.

|@filters@|Array of value filter names.|

Filters are applied in the order they are specified in the control file. If [node:import/control/value-conversion/generic-value-mapping:generic value mapping] is used, this is performed before the filters.


h2. Example

<pre>language=json
{
    "source": "PERSON-USERNAME",
    "destination": "load:by-ref",
    "name": "ref",
    "filters": ["haplo:username-to-ref"]
