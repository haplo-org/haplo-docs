The @text@ data type represents Unicode text.

Usually this is a single line of text, with [node:import/control/value-conversion/data-type/text-paragraph] and [node:import/control/value-conversion/data-type/text-multiline] types used for longer runs of text.

Numbers and booleans are converted to a string, other types of values are rejected.
