The @telephone-number@ data type represents telephone numbers.

It accepts any reasonably formatted string as input, and will reformat it into fully a valid phone number, removing 'optional' digits such as redundant trunk codes and ensuring it has a valid country code.

If an international dialing code is not included in the number, it will make a reasonable 'guess' based on the format of the number, and the @country@ property in the instruction.

|@country@|(optional) The ISO two digit code of the country to assume numbers are from if unclear in the given input string. Defaults to @GB@.|

For best results, format the input numbers with the full international dialling code.

    "destination": "profile",
    "name": "std:attribute:telephone",
    "country": "US"
}
</pre>
