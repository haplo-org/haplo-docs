The @postal-address@ value type is a [node:import/control/value-conversion/structured-value:structured value] representing the name of a person.

The associated @value:postal-address@ pseudo-destination has the fields:

|@street1@|Street address (line 1)|
|@street2@|Street address (line 2)|
|@city@|City|
|@county@|County|
|@postcode@|Postcode|
|@country@|Country two letter ISO code|

The @country@ is required, and must be a two letter "ISO Alpha-2 code":https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/, such as @"GB"@. If your data uses country names, they will need to be mapped, either by pre-processing the data, or implementing the [node:import/control/value-conversion/generic-value-mapping:mapping in the control file].
