title: Qualifier
--

Some Haplo values are [node:app/information/qualifiers:qualified]. To specify a Qualifier, add the @qualifier@ property to the Instruction. The value is the API code of the Qualifier, which can be found in System Management.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > System management > Qualifiers

Qualifiers can be used with [node:import/control/instruction/field], [node:import/control/instruction/field-structured] and [node:import/control/instruction/set-value] Instructions.

If the Destination does not support Qualifiers, then any Qualifier value is silently ignored.

}
