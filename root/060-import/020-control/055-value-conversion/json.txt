title: JSON data type
--

*Names* with the @json@ data type require a JSON-compatible structure. Generally the format is unspecified by the model, or depends on other data, so can't be reflected in the *Model*.

Setting these values generally requires using JSON input files, and using the [node:import/control/instruction/field] instruction to copy a dictionary style *Object* value from the input *Record* into the Name.
