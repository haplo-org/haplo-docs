After reviewing the application's *Model* and the structure of the data to import, you need to write a control file.

The root properties are:

|@"dataImportControlFileVersion"@|The version of the control file, which must be @0@.|
|@"model"@|The name of the *Model* to import the data into.|
|@"files"@|Describes how to interpret input files.|
|@"recordProcessor"@|Optional name of a custom process to adjust the input data, [node:import/developer/record-processor:provided by a plugin].|
|@"instructions"@|How to interpret the @Records@ in the input files.|
|@"mapping"@|Describes how to map input values.|


h2. Control file generator

There is a control file generator utility in the admin UI.

CLICK_PATH TOOLS > Data import > Models > (model name) > Generate control file...

Select the *Names* you want to include in the control file, and click _Generate control file_ at the bottom of the page. By default, single values are set, but select _multivalue_ next to a name to generate the appropriate instructions for multiple values.

This control file is unlikely to be able to be used without changes. Change all the placeholders, marked with TODO, and ensure the [node:import/control/instruction/new] or [node:import/control/instruction/load] instructions set up the right data for import.
