title: Mapping
--

Many attributes in Haplo objects are described as links to other objects. These values appear as the @ref@ data type in *Names*.

Mappings in the control file provide a mechanism for mapping from values in the input files to references to the other objects, and are referenced by [node:import/control/value-conversion/data-type/ref:ref value conversions] in *Instructions* to map input data.

The @mapping@ property in the Control file is a dictionary of mapping name to mapping properties:

|@types@|An array of API codes of the types of object this mapping maps to.|
|@using@|What method is used to identify the object.|
|@value@|A dictionary of input value to object identifier.|

Example mappings can be generated through the admin interface by clicking 'Map' next to a @ref@ *Name*.


h2. Identifying the mapped object

Mappings need to identify the other object unambiguously.

h3. behaviour

The best way is to set @using@ to @"behaviour"@ and use the [node:dev/plugin/o/behaviour:configured behaviour codes] to identify the objects precisely, even if they're edited by the system administrator of your application.

Where you're mapping to a list type set up by one of the plugins, these will already have configured behaviour codes set.

h3. title

If behaviour codes cannot be used, then the @"title"@ option can be used if the number of objects is less than a few thousand to prevent excessively large control files. This limit means it is only suitable for mapping to a small number of objects which are used as classifications, and cannot be used to map to people or organisation names.

The @values@ will match, case sensitively, to any of the titles of the objects with the given @types@.



h2. Example

<pre>language=json
"mapping": {
    "project-mode": {
        "types": [
            "example:type:project-mode"
        ],
        "using": "behaviour",
        "values": {
            "FULL": "example:list:project-mode:full-time",
            "PART": "example:list:project-mode:part-time"
        }
    }
}
</pre>
