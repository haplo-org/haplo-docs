The standard Reporting plugin provides a REST style API for access to information stored in reporting collections.

To get a list of [node:standard/reporting/collections] in an application, use [node:standard/reporting/rest-api/collections]. Then, to get information on the facts available, use [node:standard/reporting/rest-api/collection]. Finally, use [node:standard/reporting/rest-api/collection-data] to retrieve facts.

All APIs take an optional @output=pretty@ argument to pretty-print the output JSON.

The service user accessing this API must be a member of the @Reporting API@ group (code @std:group:reporting-api@).

For extra security, create the [node:dev/api-key:API key] with a _Request path_ of @/api/reporting/v0/@ to restrict your API key to the Reporting API.
