title: Action Panel
--

Plugin name: @std_action_panel@

The standard Action Panel plugin provides an [node:plugin/elements:Element] which uses [node:plugin/templates/std-template/ui-panel] standard templates to add UI elements to the home page and objects.

It's especially good for creating menus and composing UI from multiple co-operating plugins. It uses [node:plugin/o/service] to ask other plugins to call methods on a [node:plugin/interface/panel-builder] object.

To use Action Panels:

 # Add the Action Panel Elements to [node:standard/action-panel/element:objects or the home page] in your @requirements.schema@ file.
 # Implement a Service to [node:standard/action-panel/services:add items to the panels].
