h2. Concepts


h3. Context

The @context@ object is avalable in rendering contexts, and is used to pass around information that may be helpful for rendering the full page.

Example values that can be set in the @context@ object:

|@object@|The StoreObject for which this is the public page|
|@pageTitle@|The title of the page being rendered|
|@hint@|An object containing implementation-specific 'hints' for rendering options for this page. eg. @isHomePage=true@|


h3. Page parts

A page part defines a block of UI to be used in one or more places in a publication. They can be flexibly re-used between publications, or pages within a publication, defining common functionality.
