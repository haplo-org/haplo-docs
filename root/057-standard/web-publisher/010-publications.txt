title: Publication Definition
--

A publication is a public interface to a Haplo system. Data is exposed through a publication by application code.

The behaviour of a publication is defined using the @publication@ interface. Plugins register a new publications by calling @P.webPublication.register()@, with @std:web-publisher@ in the plugin's @use@ list in @plugin.json@.

h3. Retrieving publication objects

If other plugins need to retrieve a publication object, they can do so using the @"std:web_publisher:get_publication"@ service. This takes a single argument, the @name@ of the publication.
