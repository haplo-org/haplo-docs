title: Files
--

There are various methods available to a publication for altering the display of files and the permissions for downloading them.

Note: File downloads are not permitted for the service user by default.

h3(function). setFileThumbnailSize(size)

Sets the size of thumbnails to display in the publication

Arguments:

|@size@|An integer representing the pixel dimension to be squared, e.g. 64|

h3(function). addFileDownloadPermissionHandler(fn)

Register a function which will be called with a [node:plugin/interface/file] or [node:plugin/interface/file-identifier], and a result object with property @allow@ which will allow the download if set to @true@

Example Usage:

<pre>language=javascript
publication.addFileDownloadPermissionHandler(function(fileOrIdentifier, result) {
    if(P.db.permitImages.select().where("digest","=",fileOrIdentifier.digest).count() > 0) {
        result.allow = true;
    }
});
</pre>

h3(function). permitFileDownloadsForServiceUser()

This is a standard implementation which permits the download of any file that is a value in an attribute or attribute group visible by the service user on an object.

h3(function). isFileDownloadPermitted(fileOrIdentifier)

Returns a boolean to indicate whether the service user is permitted to download the given @fileOrIdentifier@.

h3(function). deferredRenderImageFileTag(fileOrIdentifier, spec)

Returns the deferredRender for the given image file or undefined if the provided @fileOrIdentifier@ is not an image.
The @spec@ object is used to alter the image tag that is returned and can have properties:

|@maxWidth@|The maximum width of the object (after any HiDPI scaling), sets the @width@ property in the returned @<img>@ tag|
|@maxHeight@|The maximum height of the image (after any HiDPI scaling), sets the @height@ property in the returned @<img>@ tag|
|@hiDPI@|Boolean to set whether the image is to be scaled for HiDPI screens|
|@title@|The text to be set as the title attribute in the returned  @<img>@ tag|
|@alt@|The text to be included in the alt attribute in the returned @<img>@ tag|
