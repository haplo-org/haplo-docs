Objects implementing the @TransitionUI@ interface are used to control the transition user interface by the [node:standard/workflow/definition/handlers#transitionUI] handler.


h2. Interface

h3(property). backLinkText

The standard @backLinkText@ property for the back button. Set to change the label.


h3(property). M

The workflow Instance.


h3(property). requestedTransition

The name of the transition requested by the user. (read only)


h3(function). preventTransition()

Call to prevent this transition taking place.


h3(function). redirect(url)

After the transition is complete, redirect the user to @url@.

It may be easier to use the @transitionUIPostTransitionRedirectForActionableUser@ handler which selects on the post-transition state.


h3(function). addFormDeferred(position, deferred)

Add some additional user interface to the transition confirmation form.

@position@ is either @"top"@ or @"bottom"@.

@deferred@ is a deferred render returned from [node:plugin/interface/template#deferredRender].
