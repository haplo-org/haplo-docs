title: Notes
long_title: Notes feature
--

The notes feature adds a simple notes system to the built-in transition UI, and displays them in the timeline. Users can also enter notes at any time.

You can optionally use 'private' notes which are only visible to a subset of participants in the process.

The last few days of notes will be added to the notification emails.


h2. Example

To add notes to a workflow where everyone but the "researcher" user can see private notes:

<pre>language=javascript
EgWorkflow.use("std:notes", {
    canSeePrivateNotes: function(M, user) {
        return !M.hasRole(user, "researcher");
    }
});
</pre>


h2. Usage

The second argument to @use()@ is the configuration, which has properties:

h3(key). canSeePrivateNotes

@function(M, user)@ taking the workflow instance and the user.

Return true if the user can see private notes.


h3(key). canAddNonTransitionNote

@function(M, user)@ taking the workflow instance and the user.

Return true if the user can add notes at any time in the process.


h2. Text

The notes system uses configurable text to explain private notes to users.

Note this, and the 'private' name, can be configured globally using the [node:standard/workflow/definition/text/name:NAME() system].

The following names are searched.
